Java, a well-established language in the field of programming is recognized for its diverse range of exceptions and error handling procedures. Despite being a renowned language, developers occasionally come across exceptions and errors during the coding process. One of the most common is the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. Digging deep into this exception can enlighten the developers with a plethora of insights. Hence, this article illuminates the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` along with code examples and their solutions to fortify your programming skills in Java. 

## Overview of `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`

The `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` in Java is a form of `RunTimeException` which is thrown to indicate that we have accessed an array with an illegal or invalid index. The index is either negative or greater than/equal to the size of the array. This exception extends the `IndexOutOfBoundsException` class, which is a subclass of `RuntimeException`.

Below is a prototype of creating this exception:

```java
public class ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException extends IndexOutOfBoundsException
```

## Encountering `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`

To further comprehend the exception, let’s delve into an example:

```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = new int[5];
        System.out.println(arr[10]);
    }
}
```
The above code tries to access the 10th element of the array `arr` which only has 5 elements. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) throws the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` as shown below:

```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 10
```

Note that in Java, array indexing starts from 0, not 1. Therefore accessing an array element at the size of the array or more will also cause this exception.

## How to Prevent `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`?

The simplest way to prevent this exception is through validating the index before its usage. We can check if an index is within the bounds of the array before we attempt to access the data at that index. Here’s an example on handling this exception:

```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int[] arr = new int[5];
            System.out.println(arr[10]);
        } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            System.out.println("Array index out of bound!");
        }
    }
}
```

In this code, the JVM will not terminate the program due to the exception. Instead, it invokes the `catch` block, and the message "Array index out of bound!" is printed to the standard output.

## Effective Usage of Try-Catch

Using `try-catch` for each array index access is not a recommended practice in an extensive coding routine owing to the following reasons:

- It can make your code quite verbose and complicated to read.
- Try-catch blocks add a lot of overhead to the JVM, making your program slower.

A better approach would be to ensure that your code does not attempt to access out-of-bounds indices. This can be accomplished by:

- Using carefully crafted loops which correctly limit the indices.
- Validating user input or others that influence array indices.

## Conclusion

Mastery over exceptions and error handling is a distinctive feature of an adept Java developer. Equipped with the understanding of `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` and how to tackle them, developers can build fault-tolerant and efficient applications.
