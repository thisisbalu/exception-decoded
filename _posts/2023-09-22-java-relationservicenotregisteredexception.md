In the dynamic world of Java programming, exceptions are an imperative aspect that shapes how our codes run and execute. While they can be daunting, understanding them is crucial to developing robust and error-free applications. Today we turn our spotlight on one such exception - the `RelationServiceNotRegisteredException`. We delve into the realms of what it means, why it occurs, and illustrate a concrete step-by-step guide to handling it smartly for optimized code performance. 

## Understanding RelationServiceNotRegisteredException

Before we unbox the `RelationServiceNotRegisteredException`, let's frame our minds around why Java presents exceptions to developers. An exception is the way Java's ecosystem notifies us, developers, that the system has encountered an anomalous situation it wasn't capable of handling. In the context of `RelationServiceNotRegisteredException`, we face an exception that is directly linked to the Java Management Extensions (JMX) - the technology that supplies tools for managing and monitoring applications.

`RelationServiceNotRegisteredException` is a checked exception that is thrown when the involved Relation Service is not registered in the MBeanServer. It's part of the `javax.management.relation` package and is often encountered when working with JMX relations, a key feature in monitoring and management tasks.

```Java
package javax.management.relation;

public class RelationServiceNotRegisteredException
extends RelationException
```
We primarily get this exception when we attempt to perform operations on a `RelationService` that hasn't been registered with the MBean Server.

## When Do You Encounter RelationServiceNotRegisteredException?

Suppose we're building an application that involves managing and monitoring using JMX where we have occasion to create, modify, or delete `RelationType` objects or `Relation` objects. During this, if we attempt operations on an unregistered `RelationServiceMBean` or on another MBean representing a `RelationType` or a `Relation`, Java eloquently winds up throwing `RelationServiceNotRegisteredException`.

Consider the following code snippet as an example:

```Java
RelationService rs = new RelationService(false);

// Registering it in the MBeanServer
ObjectName rsName = new ObjectName("relation:type=RelationService");
mbs.registerMBean(rs, rsName);

// Calling addRelationType with unregistered RelationService
try {
    rs.addRelationType(rt);
} catch (RelationServiceNotRegisteredException 
           | InvalidRelationTypeException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
## How to Handle this Exception?

Fortunately, handling `RelationServiceNotRegisteredException` is uncomplicated. By ensuring that our RelationService is registered with the MBean Server before performing operations upon it, we can keep this exception at bay. 

```Java
RelationService rs = new RelationService(false);

// Registering it in the MBeanServer
ObjectName rsName = new ObjectName("relation:type=RelationService");
mbs.registerMBean(rs, rsName);

// Now we can perform operations without facing RelationServiceNotRegisteredException
try {
    rs.addRelationType(rt);
} catch (InvalidRelationTypeException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
Moreover, following good practices of exception handling, such as employing specific catch blocks and generating informative error messages, can be instrumental in managing this exception effectively. This not only helps improve the robustness of the code but also aids in debugging.

In conclusion, the `RelationServiceNotRegisteredException` in Java stems from attempting to work with an unregistered Relation Service. By ensuring proper registration prior to performing any operations, and by adhering to best practices for exception handling, you can effectively prevent this exception in your Java applications. This walkthrough has hopefully clarified the reasons, implications and handling of `RelationServiceNotRegisteredException`. Step on and code on, tech savvies!
