In today's tutorial, we will be exploring a unique aspect of Spring Framework â€“ FieldError. As each technical glitch acts as a stepping stone to the journey of becoming a proficient programmer, understanding the Spring's FieldError is immensely beneficial.

## What is FieldError in Spring?

In Spring Framework, `FieldError` is an instance of `ObjectError`. It is an object that encapsulates and handles errors related to a specific field in an object. This error capability is leveraged by Spring to capture and communicate issues associated with form binding and validation works during a web request.

```java
public interface FieldError extends ObjectError {
    String getField();
    Object getRejectedValue();
    boolean isBindingFailure();
}
```

## Understanding the FieldError API

Here's a simplified look at the different methods provided by the `FieldError` interface:

1. `getField()`: This method retrieves the affected field's name.
2. `getRejectedValue()`: It fetches the rejected field value that led to the error.
3. `isBindingFailure()`: As the name suggests, this method indicates whether the error was due to binding failure.

## Practically Implementing FieldError

Let's look at a typical Spring MVC scenario. Assume you have a `UserController` class that handles user registration in an application, and you want to validate the incoming user data.

```java
@Controller
public class UserController {
   
    @PostMapping("/register")
    public String register(@Valid User user, BindingResult bindingResult) {
       
        if(bindingResult.hasErrors()) {
            List<FieldError> fieldErrors = bindingResult.getFieldErrors();
            fieldErrors.forEach(err -> System.out.println(err.getField() + ": " + err.getDefaultMessage()));
            return "registration";
        }
       
        // Continue with registration process...
        return "success";
    }
}
```

In the code above, the `@Valid` annotation triggers validation of the `User` object. If any validation constraints fail, Spring populates a `BindingResult` object with a list of `FieldError` objects. We can easily loop through them and print the occurred errors.

## How to Handle FieldError in REST APIs?

Handling FieldErrors in REST APIs is somewhat different. Instead of returning a view name like in MVC controllers, REST controllers return a response object. Let's adapt our previous example for a REST API scenario.

```java
@RestController
public class UserController {
   
    @PostMapping("/register")
    public ResponseEntity<?> register(@Valid @RequestBody User user, BindingResult bindingResult) {
       
        if(bindingResult.hasErrors()) {
            Map<String, String> errors = new HashMap<>();
            bindingResult.getFieldErrors().forEach(error -> 
                errors.put(error.getField(), error.getDefaultMessage()));
            return new ResponseEntity<Map<String, String>>(errors, HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
        }
       
        // Continue with registration process...
        return new ResponseEntity<User>(user, HttpStatus.CREATED);
    }
}
```

In the above snippet, if validation fails, a `ResponseEntity` with HTTP status `BAD_REQUEST` and a map of error messages are returned. Otherwise, the newly created `User` object and HTTP status `CREATED` are sent as the response.

## Conclusion

FieldError is a crucial part of the Spring Framework, specifically in the data binding and validation scenarios. The knowledge of FieldError opens doors to effectively using Spring and aids in delivering seamless web applications with apt error handling.

Understanding, implementing, and applying FieldError effectively is indeed a commendable attribute in a Spring-based Java Developer's journey.
