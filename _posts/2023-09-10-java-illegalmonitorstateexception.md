In Java, multithreading is a fundamental concept that allows programs to perform multiple tasks concurrently, optimizing efficiency and responsiveness. To achieve this, Java provides a robust mechanism called monitors and locks. However, when working with monitors, it's essential to be aware of potential issues that may arise, such as the `IllegalMonitorStateException`.

## What is IllegalMonitorStateException?

`IllegalMonitorStateException` is an exception that occurs when a method is called on an object's monitor, but the current thread does not hold the monitor's lock. It is a subclass of `RuntimeException` that is typically thrown by methods such as `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()`, which are essential for managing synchronization in Java.

The primary purpose of monitors and locks is to allow threads to coordinate their activities efficiently. Monitors enable threads to interact and safely share resources by synchronizing their access to critical sections of code. This synchronization is achieved using the `synchronized` keyword or explicit Lock objects.

## Reasons for IllegalMonitorStateException

The `IllegalMonitorStateException` primarily occurs when a method that requires a monitor to be owned by the current thread is invoked improperly. Here are a few common scenarios where this exception can occur:

### 1. Calling `wait()`, `notify()`, or `notifyAll()` without synchronized block

To avoid potential race conditions or concurrent access issues, invoking methods like `wait()`, `notify()`, or `notifyAll()` must be performed within a synchronized block or a synchronized method. This ensures that the current thread holds the monitor's lock before calling these methods.

Consider the following example:

```java
Object obj = new Object();

// ...

try {
    obj.wait(); // Throws IllegalMonitorStateException
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In this case, calling `wait()` on the `obj` without obtaining the lock using the `synchronized` keyword will result in an `IllegalMonitorStateException`.

### 2. Using the monitor of a different object

When calling `wait()`, `notify()`, or `notifyAll()`, these methods must be invoked on the same object whose monitor's lock is desired. Invoking them on a different object will lead to an `IllegalMonitorStateException`.

Let's illustrate this with an example:

```java
Object obj1 = new Object();
Object obj2 = new Object();

// ...

synchronized (obj1) {
    obj2.notify(); // Throws IllegalMonitorStateException
}
```

Calling `notify()` on `obj2` while holding the lock on `obj1` will throw an `IllegalMonitorStateException` since the monitor associated with `obj2` is not owned by the current thread.

## How to handle IllegalMonitorStateException

To handle `IllegalMonitorStateException`, it's crucial to ensure that the methods `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` are invoked correctly within a synchronized block or a synchronized method. Here are some best practices to avoid this exception:

### 1. Use synchronized blocks or methods

Always wrap the invocation of `wait()`, `notify()`, or `notifyAll()` within a synchronized block or a synchronized method. This ensures that the current thread has acquired the monitor's lock before calling these methods.

```java
synchronized (obj) {
    obj.wait(); // Correct usage
}
```

### 2. Check the lock ownership

Before invoking `wait()`, `notify()`, or `notifyAll()`, ensure that the current thread owns the monitor's lock associated with the object. You can use the `synchronized` keyword or explicit locks to acquire ownership of the monitor.

```java
synchronized (obj) {
    obj.notify(); // Correct usage
}
```

### 3. Use explicit locks

Instead of relying solely on the `synchronized` keyword, you can use explicit lock objects from the `java.util.concurrent.locks` package. These provide a fine-grained control over locks and offer advanced functionalities like reentrant locks, condition variables, and timed waits.

```java
Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

// ...

lock.lock();
try {
    condition.await(); // Correct usage
} finally {
    lock.unlock();
}
```

## Conclusion

Understanding the `IllegalMonitorStateException` is crucial when working with Java's multithreading and synchronization mechanisms. By ensuring that methods like `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` are used correctly within synchronized blocks or methods, you can prevent this exception from occurring.

In this article, we learned about the reasons why `IllegalMonitorStateException` is thrown and explored best practices to handle it effectively. Remember to always acquire the monitor's lock properly and use synchronized blocks or explicit locks for safe multithreaded programming in Java.

Keep these tips in mind while coding and troubleshooting multithreaded applications, and you'll be well-equipped to manage synchronization issues and avoid `IllegalMonitorStateException`.
