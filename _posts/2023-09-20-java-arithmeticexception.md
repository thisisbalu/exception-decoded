In the world of Java programming, understanding exceptions, their causes, and how to handle them is essential. This discussion today revolves around one such type of exception – `ArithmeticException`. This Java-specific anomaly usually occurs amid arithmetic error scenarios. So, let's dig deeper and demystify the `ArithmeticException` in Java.

## What is `ArithmeticException` in Java?

In Java, the `ArithmeticException` is part of Java’s Exception Hierarchy, more specifically, a subclass of `java.lang.RuntimeException`. This exception typically occurs when an exceptional arithmetic condition has been encountered. In most cases, this involves operations like division by zero.

```java
public class JavaArithmeticException {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(50/0);
    }
}
```
Running this code would throw the `ArithmeticException` since dividing any value by zero is mathematically undefined.

## Unchecked Exception

Like `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, `NullPointerException`, and `NumberFormatException`, the `ArithmeticException` is also an unchecked exception. This means that the compiler doesn't check whether the exception has been handled—or not—at compile time.

Yet, good programming and coding ethics recommend handling exceptions—even unchecked ones. In the case of `ArithmeticException`, you can use a simple `try-catch` block to prevent your program from terminating abnormally. 

```java
public class JavaArithmeticException {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            System.out.println(50/0);
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero");
        }
    }
}
```

In this version of the code, we prevent abrupt termination by catching the exception and printing an error message instead.

## Preventing ArithmeticException

Prevention is always better than finding a cure, and it holds for exceptions too. Using conditional statements, we can avert the `ArithmeticException` in the first place. 

```java
public class JavaArithmeticException {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int denominator = 0;
        if(denominator != 0) {
            System.out.println(50/denominator);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Denominator should not be zero!");
        }
    }
}
```

Here, we apply a simple condition to check if the denominator is zero. If true, we bypass the division operation, thus preventing the `ArithmeticException`.

## Conclusion

In the vast universe of Java, the `ArithmeticException` is a pesky, yet vital concept. While programmers may deem handling these unchecked exceptions unnecessary, it's like playing with fire – risky at best. Proper exception-handling procedures enhance code reliability and maintainability, ultimately creating more robust and foolproof programs.

While it's not complicated to handle and avoid `ArithmeticException` in Java, understanding its mechanics is essential. Just remember – "prevention is better than cure." So instead of just suppressing the exception, it's better to overhaul the conditions creating the situation.

Through this guide, you've acquainted yourself with handling `ArithmeticException` in Java. Don't stop here. Keep exploring, keep coding, and keep mastering Java.
