###### Keywords: Java, ExecutionControl.ExecutionControlException, Exception handling in Java

Java is a versatile and widely-used programming language that has its comprehensive set of rules and structures. One such aspect of Java that we are diving into today is the `ExecutionControl.ExecutionControlException`. This article aims to help both novice and expert programmers understand the ins and outs of this exception and how to handle it more effectively in the Java environment.

## What is ExecutionControl.ExecutionControlException?

The `ExecutionControl.ExecutionControlException` belongs to a class in Java that extends the RuntimeException class. This exception arises when a piece of code cannot be executed for some reason. The `ExecutionControl.ExecutionControlException` is used to signify these exceptional conditions that must be caught, usually using try-catch blocks.

Before we proceed further, it's crucial to understand an integral concept in Java â€“ Exception handling. Exception handling is a robust mechanism that helps manage runtime errors, thereby maintaining the normal flow of the software execution. 

## Understanding the ExecutionControl Class

In the context of this exception, it's essential to comprehend the `ExecutionControl` class, which is a part of the Java Development Kit(JDK). The `ExecutionControl` class is used to execute a piece of code that is provided in the form of a string during runtime. If there are issues during the execution, it'll throw specific exceptions; one of them being `ExecutionControl.ExecutionControlException`.


Example of ExecutionControl code:

```java
ExecutionControl controller = vm.newRedirectingExecutionControl(stdOut, stdErr);
String code = "public class Test { static public void main(String... args) throws Throwable { System.out.println(\"Hello!\"); } }";
controller.execute(code);
```

## Causes of ExecutionControl.ExecutionControlException

Some of the common reasons for `ExecutionControl.ExecutionControlException` include:

1. Syntax errors in the code string being executed
2. Runtime errors in the executing code
3. Any exception that has not been caught by the executing code.

Here's an example of a situation where an `ExecutionControl.ExecutionControlException` would be thrown:

```java
String faultyCode = "public class Test { static public void main(String... args) throws Throwable { System.out.println(\"Hello!";
ExecutionControl controller = vm.newRedirectingExecutionControl(stdOut, stdErr);
controller.execute(faultyCode);
```

In the above example, there's a syntax error in the code as the closing brace `)` is missing in the `System.out.println` line.

## How to Handle ExecutionControl.ExecutionControlException

Handling `ExecutionControl.ExecutionControlException` is done following general exception handling principles in Java. The traditional 'try-catch' block is usually used.

```java
try {
    ExecutionControl controller = vm.newRedirectingExecutionControl(stdOut, stdErr);
    String code = "public class Test { static public void main(String... args) throws Throwable { System.out.println(\"Hello!\"); } }";
    controller.execute(code);
} catch (ExecutionControl.ExecutionControlException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In the above code snippet, the `try` block contains the code that may potentially throw an exception, while the `catch` block captures the exception and prints the stack trace helping programmers to identify and rectify the problem.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, `ExecutionControl.ExecutionControlException` is part of the exception hierarchy in Java that indicates an issue with the execution of a piece of a code string at runtime. As with other Java exceptions, it should be properly handled using try-catch blocks to maintain the smooth execution flow of the program. Understanding how to correctly implement exception handling within your Java code is not just good coding practice, but it also aids in developing resilient and error-resistant software.

Happy coding!
