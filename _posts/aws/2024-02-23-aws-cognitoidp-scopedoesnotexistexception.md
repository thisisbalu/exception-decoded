## Introduction
AWS Cognito Identity Provider (Cognito IDP) is a powerful service that manages user authentication and authorization for your applications. It offers a convenient way to handle user sign-ups, sign-ins, and other security-related tasks. However, while working with Cognito IDP, you may come across an exception called `ScopeDoesNotExistException`. In this article, we will dive deep into this exception, understand its causes, and explore how to handle it effectively.

## Understanding AWS Cognito Identity Provider
Before delving into the specifics of `ScopeDoesNotExistException`, let's have a brief overview of AWS Cognito Identity Provider. Cognito IDP is a fully managed service that enables you to add user authentication and authorization to your applications with ease. It offers features like user sign-up, sign-in, multi-factor authentication, social logins, and more, all backed by robust security protocols.

## What is ScopeDoesNotExistException?
`ScopeDoesNotExistException` is an exception thrown by the `com.amazonaws.services.cognitoidp.model` package in AWS SDK for Java when an invalid scope is provided during an identity provider authorization request. The exception signifies that the requested scope does not exist for the specified user pool client.

## Causes of ScopeDoesNotExistException
This exception occurs primarily due to the following reasons:

#### 1. Incorrect client configuration
When configuring your user pool client, you define the allowed OAuth scopes for the client. If the scope mentioned in the request does not exist in your client configuration, `ScopeDoesNotExistException` will be thrown.

Consider the following code example:

```java
AdminCreateUserRequest createUserRequest = new AdminCreateUserRequest()
    .withUserPoolId("us-west-2_aBcDeFgH")
    .withUsername("johndoe")
    .withDesiredDeliveryMediums("EMAIL")
    .withUserAttributes(
        new AttributeType().withName("email").withValue("johndoe@example.com")
    );

AdminCreateUserResult createUserResult = cognitoClient.adminCreateUser(createUserRequest);
String username = createUserResult.getUser().getUsername();

try {
    AdminInitiateAuthRequest initiateAuthRequest = new AdminInitiateAuthRequest()
        .withUserPoolId("us-west-2_aBcDeFgH")
        .withClientId("abcdefghijklm123456")
        .withAuthFlow(AuthFlowType.USER_PASSWORD_AUTH)
        .withAuthParameters(
            Map.of(
                "USERNAME", username,
                "PASSWORD", "MyPassword123"
            )
        )
        .withScopes("openid", "email", "phone");  // Invalid scope "phone"

    AdminInitiateAuthResult initiateAuthResult = cognitoClient.adminInitiateAuth(initiateAuthRequest);
    // ...
} catch (ScopeDoesNotExistException e) {
    // Handle the exception
}
```

In the code above, the `AdminInitiateAuthRequest` incorrectly specifies a scope called `"phone"`, which is not present in the user pool client's configuration. This will trigger the `ScopeDoesNotExistException`, and you can catch it to handle accordingly.

#### 2. Incorrect scope usage
Another common scenario leading to `ScopeDoesNotExistException` is the misuse of scopes while making authorization requests. Ensure that you provide only the scopes that are configured and valid for the respective user pool client.

## Handling ScopeDoesNotExistException
To handle `ScopeDoesNotExistException` gracefully, you can follow these steps:

#### 1. Catch the exception
Wrap the code block that throws the `ScopeDoesNotExistException` in a try-catch block and catch the exception. This allows you to handle the exception gracefully and perform specific actions based on your application's requirements.

```java
try {
    // Code that throws ScopeDoesNotExistException
} catch (ScopeDoesNotExistException e) {
    // Handle the exception
}
```

#### 2. Provide meaningful feedback to the user
When catching the `ScopeDoesNotExistException`, extract relevant details from the exception object and provide meaningful feedback to the user. This feedback can help users understand why their request failed and guide them in providing valid scopes.

```java
catch (ScopeDoesNotExistException e) {
    String invalidScope = e.getInvalidScope();
    String validScopes = e.getValidScopes().toString();

    // Inform the user that the provided scope is invalid and suggest valid scopes
    String errorMessage = "Invalid scope: " + invalidScope + ". Available scopes: " + validScopes;
    // Display the error message to the user
}
```

By extracting the invalid scope and the valid scopes from the exception, you can form a helpful error message for the user.

## Conclusion
In this article, we explored the `ScopeDoesNotExistException` in AWS Cognito Identity Provider. We learned that this exception occurs when an invalid scope is provided during an identity provider authorization request. We discussed the two primary causes of this exception and explored how to handle it effectively.

Remember, providing accurate and valid scopes to your authorization requests is crucial to avoid `ScopeDoesNotExistException`. By following best practices and incorporating proper error handling, you can ensure a smooth user experience in your applications while working with AWS Cognito Identity Provider.
