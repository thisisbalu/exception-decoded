If you have been developing applications on AWS with CodeStar, chances are you have encountered the `ProjectNotFoundException` at some point. It is one of the most common exceptions thrown by the `com.amazonaws.services.codestar.model` package. In this article, we will explore what this exception is, how it can occur, and how to handle it effectively.

## Understanding ProjectNotFoundException

The `ProjectNotFoundException` is an exception class provided by the AWS CodeStar SDK. It is thrown when an operation attempts to access or manipulate a project that does not exist within the CodeStar service.

### Possible Causes

#### 1. Incorrect Project Name or ARN

One common cause of the `ProjectNotFoundException` is using an incorrect project name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) while trying to access the project or perform any operations on it. It's important to double-check the project name or ARN before making any requests to the CodeStar API.

#### 2. Inconsistent Naming Convention

Another cause for the exception is having a mismatch in the naming convention used for the project. CodeStar requires projects to adhere to specific naming guidelines. If the project name does not comply with these guidelines, the `ProjectNotFoundException` may occur.

### Handling the Exception

When working with AWS CodeStar, it is essential to proactively handle the `ProjectNotFoundException` to provide meaningful feedback to users or perform appropriate fallback actions.

In Java, you can catch the `ProjectNotFoundException` using a try-catch block as shown below:

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.codestar.model.ProjectNotFoundException;

try {
    // Code that attempts to access or manipulate the project
} catch (ProjectNotFoundException e) {
    // Handle the exception
    // Log an error message or provide feedback to the user
    // Take necessary fallback actions
}
```

### Common Mistakes

#### 1. Not Checking for `ProjectNotFoundException`

One mistake developers often make is neglecting to handle the `ProjectNotFoundException`. By ignoring the exception, the application can crash or behave unexpectedly when trying to access a non-existent project. Always ensure you handle this exception gracefully to maintain the stability and usability of your application.

#### 2. Generic Exception Handling

Catching broader exceptions, such as `Exception` or `RuntimeException`, instead of specifically catching `ProjectNotFoundException`, can lead to poorly handled or unnoticed issues. It is crucial to catch the specific exception to handle it appropriately or perform fallback actions based on the scenario.

### Best Practices

#### 1. Validate the Project Name or ARN

Before making any requests involving projects in CodeStar, validate the project name or ARN to ensure accuracy. This step can help you avoid unnecessary exceptions and improve the overall reliability of your code.

```java
// Validate project name or ARN
String projectName = "my-project";
if (!isValidProjectName(projectName)) {
    // Handle the invalid project name gracefully
    // Notify the user or perform fallback actions
}
```
#### 2. Provide Clear Feedback

When the `ProjectNotFoundException` occurs, it's important to provide clear feedback to the user or log appropriate error messages. This feedback can help users understand the cause of the issue and take the necessary steps to resolve it.

```java
try {
    // Code that attempts to access or manipulate the project
} catch (ProjectNotFoundException e) {
    // Provide clear feedback to the user
    System.out.println("Project not found. Please check the project name and try again.");
    // Log the error
    logger.error("Project not found: {}", e.getMessage());
    // Take necessary fallback actions
}
```

### Conclusion

In this article, we discussed the `ProjectNotFoundException` exception commonly encountered while working with AWS CodeStar. We explored the possible causes of the exception and provided best practices for handling it effectively. By incorporating these practices into your code, you can ensure robust project management and enhance the overall user experience.

Remember to validate the project name or ARN, provide clear feedback or error messages, and always handle the exception gracefully. With these strategies in place, you'll be well-equipped to tackle the `ProjectNotFoundException` head-on, delivering a successful CodeStar application.
