## Introduction

Welcome to another technical article by **TechWiz**! In this article, we will dive deep into the `ResourceNotFoundException` class of the `com.amazonaws.services.connectwisdom.model` package in Amazon Connect Wisdom. We will explore what this exception is, when it occurs, and how to handle it effectively.

## What is the ResourceNotFoundException?

The `ResourceNotFoundException` is an exception class that belongs to the `com.amazonaws.services.connectwisdom.model` package in Amazon Connect Wisdom. This exception is thrown when an API request fails to find a requested resource.

## When does the ResourceNotFoundException occur?

The `ResourceNotFoundException` is commonly encountered when retrieving or accessing resources from Amazon Connect Wisdom, such as knowledge bases, documents, or assistant associations. It occurs when the requested resource does not exist in the system.

For example, suppose you make an API call to retrieve a specific knowledge base using its identifier. If the knowledge base with that identifier does not exist, the `ResourceNotFoundException` will be thrown.

## How to handle the ResourceNotFoundException?

To handle the `ResourceNotFoundException`, you need to implement proper error handling techniques within your application. Here's an example of how you can handle this exception:

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.connectwisdom.model.ResourceNotFoundException;

try {
    // Perform the API call to AWS Connect Wisdom
    // ...
} catch (ResourceNotFoundException e) {
    System.out.println("The requested resource was not found. Please verify the resource identifier.");
    // Additional error handling logic
}
```

In the example above, we catch the `ResourceNotFoundException` and provide a custom error message to the user. This helps them understand that the resource they are trying to access does not exist.

## Conclusion

Now you have a clear understanding of the `ResourceNotFoundException` class in Amazon Connect Wisdom. We explored what this exception is, when it occurs, and how to handle it effectively within your application.

Remember to handle this exception properly to provide a better user experience and assist users in troubleshooting any issues related to unavailable resources.
