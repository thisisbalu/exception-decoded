Are you utilizing AWS CodeCommit for your version control needs? If so, you might have encountered the `MaximumNumberOfApprovalsExceededException` exception. In this article, we will explore what this exception means, how to handle it effectively, and provide you with some code examples. So, let's dive in!

## Understanding MaximumNumberOfApprovalsExceededException

In AWS CodeCommit, the `MaximumNumberOfApprovalsExceededException` is thrown when an attempt to approve a pull request exceeds the maximum number of approvals set for that specific repository. This exception is generally encountered when there is a need for a specific number of approvals before merging a pull request, ensuring that all necessary stakeholders review and sign off on the changes.

## Handling MaximumNumberOfApprovalsExceededException

### 1. Increasing the Maximum Number of Approvals

One way to handle the `MaximumNumberOfApprovalsExceededException` is by increasing the maximum number of approvals allowed for a pull request in your repository settings. This can be done manually through the AWS CodeCommit console or programmatically using the AWS SDKs or AWS Command Line Interface (CLI).

Here's an example of how you can programmatically increase the maximum number of approvals using the AWS SDK for Java:

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.AWSCodeCommit;
import com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.AWSCodeCommitClientBuilder;
import com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.model.UpdatePullRequestApprovalRuleContentRequest;

AWSCodeCommit codeCommitClient = AWSCodeCommitClientBuilder.defaultClient();

UpdatePullRequestApprovalRuleContentRequest request = new UpdatePullRequestApprovalRuleContentRequest()
    .withPullRequestId("your-pull-request-id")
    .withApprovalRuleName("your-approval-rule-name")
    .withApprovalRuleContent("your-updated-approval-rule-content");

codeCommitClient.updatePullRequestApprovalRuleContent(request);
```

Note that you need to provide the `pullRequestId`, `approvalRuleName`, and the updated `approvalRuleContent` to successfully increase the maximum number of approvals for a specific pull request.

### 2. Adjusting Approval Rules

Another way to handle this exception is by adjusting your approval rules. Approval rules define conditions that need to be met before a pull request can be merged. By modifying these rules, you can customize the number of approvals required.

Here's an example using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to update the minimum number of approvals required:

```python
import boto3

codecommit_client = boto3.client('codecommit')

response = codecommit_client.update_approval_rule_template_content(
    approvalRuleTemplateName='your-approval-rule-template-name',
    newRuleContent='{"Version": "2012-10-26","Statements": [{"Type": "MemberOf","NumberOfApprovalsNeeded": 2,"ApprovalPoolMembers": ["arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/ApproverRole"]},{"Type": "Approvers","NumberOfApprovalsNeeded": 1}]}'
)
```

In this example, we are updating the minimum number of approvals required by modifying the `NumberOfApprovalsNeeded` property. Make sure to replace `'your-approval-rule-template-name'` with the actual name of your approval rule template.

## Conclusion

In summary, the `MaximumNumberOfApprovalsExceededException` is an exception thrown when the maximum number of approvals allowed for a pull request is exceeded. By adjusting the maximum number of approvals or modifying your approval rules, you can successfully handle this exception. Throughout this article, we presented code examples in Java and Python to demonstrate how to handle the exception programmatically.
