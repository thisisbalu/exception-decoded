## Introduction

AWS CodeCommit is a fully-managed source control service that makes it easy for teams to collaborate on code. It provides a secure and scalable solution for hosting private Git repositories. With features like access control, branch management, and automated code reviews, CodeCommit simplifies the process of version control.

In this article, we will explore a specific exception encountered while working with CodeCommit - `MaximumNumberOfApprovalsExceededException`. We will discuss what this exception means, common scenarios in which it occurs, and explore ways to handle it effectively.

## What is MaximumNumberOfApprovalsExceededException?

`MaximumNumberOfApprovalsExceededException` is an exception thrown by the `com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.model` class in the AWS SDK for CodeCommit. This exception indicates that the maximum number of approvals allowed for a pull request has been exceeded. 

When a user creates or updates a pull request in CodeCommit, they can request approval from other team members before merging the changes. CodeCommit enforces a limit on the maximum number of approvals that can be granted for a particular pull request.

## Common Scenarios

There are several scenarios in which this exception can occur:

### 1. Exceeding Maximum Approvals Threshold

CodeCommit allows you to specify the maximum number of approvals required before a pull request can be merged. If the number of approvals granted exceeds this threshold, the exception `MaximumNumberOfApprovalsExceededException` is thrown.

```java
try {
    // Create or update pull request
    // ...
} catch (MaximumNumberOfApprovalsExceededException e) {
    // Handle the exception
    // ...
}
```

### 2. Pull Request Reviews

CodeCommit also provides a feature for adding comments and initiating discussions on pull requests. If there are already a significant number of reviews or comments on a pull request, it may impact the ability to grant additional approvals.

```java
try {
    // Request approval for a pull request
    // ...
} catch (MaximumNumberOfApprovalsExceededException e) {
    // Handle the exception
    // ...
}
```

## Handling MaximumNumberOfApprovalsExceededException

When encountering the `MaximumNumberOfApprovalsExceededException`, it is crucial to handle it gracefully. Here are a few approaches you can consider:

### 1. Prioritizing Existing Approvals

If the maximum number of approvals has been reached, you can prioritize the existing approvals based on the assigned roles or expertise of the reviewers. This ensures that the most critical feedback is included and allows for a more efficient decision-making process.

```java
try {
    // Request prioritized approvals for the pull request
    // ...
} catch (MaximumNumberOfApprovalsExceededException e) {
    // Handle the exception by prioritizing existing approvals
    // ...
}
```

### 2. Reviewer Rotation

To avoid encountering the maximum approvals limit, consider rotating the reviewers for each pull request. By distributing the responsibility of reviewing code among team members, you can ensure a continuous flow of approvals without any delays or exceptions.

```java
try {
    // Request approval from rotating reviewers
    // ...
} catch (MaximumNumberOfApprovalsExceededException e) {
    // Handle the exception by rotating reviewers
    // ...
}
```

## Conclusion

Understanding the `MaximumNumberOfApprovalsExceededException` in AWS CodeCommit is essential for developing a successful workflow with pull requests. By handling this exception effectively, you can ensure a smooth collaboration process and maintain the quality and integrity of your codebase.
