## What is AWS Billing Conductor? <a name="what-is-aws-billing-conductor"></a>
AWS Billing Conductor is a managed service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that simplifies the management and automation of billing processes. It provides a comprehensive set of APIs that enable users to programmatically interact with AWS billing data, automate cost reporting, and monitor usage. With AWS Billing Conductor, you can effectively optimize your AWS costs, gain insights into your spending patterns, and streamline your billing operations.

## Introduction to ValidationExceptionField <a name="introduction-to-validationexceptionfield"></a>
The `ValidationExceptionField` class is part of the `com.amazonaws.services.billingconductor.model` package in AWS Billing Conductor. It is specifically designed to handle validation errors that occur during processing input fields. When an error is encountered, AWS Billing Conductor throws a `ValidationException` containing the `ValidationExceptionField` object, which contains information about the specific field that failed validation.

## Functionality and Usage <a name="functionality-and-usage"></a>
The `ValidationExceptionField` class provides several methods and properties that can be utilized to retrieve detailed information about the validation error. Some of the key functionalities and usage scenarios include:

1. **GetFieldName():** This method returns the name of the field that failed validation. It allows you to identify the specific input field that caused the error and take appropriate actions.

```java
ValidationExceptionField validationExceptionField = new ValidationExceptionField();
String fieldName = validationExceptionField.getFieldName();
System.out.println("Failed Field: " + fieldName);
```

2. **GetMessage():** This method retrieves the error message associated with the failed field. It helps in understanding the reason behind the validation failure.

```java
ValidationExceptionField validationExceptionField = new ValidationExceptionField();
String errorMessage = validationExceptionField.getMessage();
System.out.println("Error Message: " + errorMessage);
```

3. **GetRejectedValue():** If the validation failure is related to the value provided for the field, this method allows you to access the rejected value. It is particularly useful when troubleshooting and pinpointing the exact cause of the error.

```java
ValidationExceptionField validationExceptionField = new ValidationExceptionField();
String rejectedValue = validationExceptionField.getRejectedValue();
System.out.println("Rejected Value: " + rejectedValue);
```

## Benefits of ValidationExceptionField <a name="benefits-of-validationexceptionfield"></a>
The `ValidationExceptionField` class offers several benefits, including:

1. **Error Identification:** By providing detailed information about the failed field, the `ValidationExceptionField` helps in easily identifying errors and their root cause.
2. **Troubleshooting:** Access to the rejected value associated with the field enables developers to effectively troubleshoot and debug validation failures.
3. **Better User Experience:** Proper handling of validation errors leads to better user experience by providing meaningful error messages that guide users to correct their input.

## Code Examples <a name="code-examples"></a>
Let's take a look at some code examples that demonstrate the usage of `ValidationExceptionField`:

```java
try {
   // Code that may throw ValidationException
} catch (ValidationException ex) {
   List<ValidationExceptionField> failedFields = ex.getFailedFields();
   for (ValidationExceptionField field : failedFields) {
      String fieldName = field.getFieldName();
      String errorMessage = field.getMessage();
      String rejectedValue = field.getRejectedValue();
      System.out.println("Failed Field: " + fieldName);
      System.out.println("Error Message: " + errorMessage);
      System.out.println("Rejected Value: " + rejectedValue);
   }
}
```

In the above example, we catch a `ValidationException` and iterate over the list of `ValidationExceptionField` objects. We retrieve the field name, error message, and rejected value for each failed field and print them to the console. This information can be further utilized to handle the error gracefully or provide suitable feedback to the user.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
AWS Billing Conductor's `ValidationExceptionField` class plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and accuracy by handling validation errors gracefully. By providing detailed information about the failed fields, error messages, and rejected values, this class empowers developers to efficiently troubleshoot and resolve validation issues. When used effectively, the `ValidationExceptionField` class enhances the overall user experience and improves the reliability of AWS billing operations.
