As more and more applications move to the cloud, managing, scaling, and maintaining databases has become a crucial task. To address this need, Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers AWS Memory DB, a fully managed, Redis-compatible in-memory database service. AWS Memory DB provides high throughput, low latency, and durable data storage.

However, like any distributed system, issues may arise while using AWS Memory DB. Among the possible errors, one explicitly raised is the `SnapshotNotFoundException`. This article will dive into what this error means, its possible causes, and how to handle it efficiently.

## Understanding SnapshotNotFoundException

The `SnapshotNotFoundException` is an exception class within the `com.amazonaws.services.memorydb.model` package of the AWS SDK for Java, specifically designed for AWS Memory DB. This exception indicates that the specified snapshot could not be found in the Memory DB cluster.

Whenever you attempt to execute a specific operation related to snapshots—such as restoring a cluster from a snapshot or deleting a snapshot—you may encounter this exception. Notably, it is important to understand the underlying causes to address this error effectively.

## Possible Causes

### 1. Incorrect Snapshot Identifier

The most common cause of the `SnapshotNotFoundException` is an incorrect snapshot identifier. When referencing a snapshot, it is crucial to ensure the identifier is accurate and matches an existing snapshot associated with the Memory DB cluster.

For example, consider the following code snippet that attempts to restore a cluster from a snapshot using the `RestoreSnapshot` operation:

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.memorydb.AmazonMemoryDB;
import com.amazonaws.services.memorydb.AmazonMemoryDBClientBuilder;
import com.amazonaws.services.memorydb.model.RestoreSnapshotRequest;

public class MemoryDBExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AmazonMemoryDB client = AmazonMemoryDBClientBuilder.defaultClient();
        
        String snapshotIdentifier = "snapshot-12345"; // Incorrect identifier
        
        RestoreSnapshotRequest request = new RestoreSnapshotRequest()
            .withSnapshotName(snapshotIdentifier)
            .withClusterName("my-cluster");
        
        try {
            client.restoreSnapshot(request);
        } catch (com.amazonaws.services.memorydb.model.SnapshotNotFoundException ex) {
            System.out.println("Snapshot not found. Please verify the snapshot identifier.");
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example, if the `snapshotIdentifier` is incorrect or does not match an existing snapshot, the `SnapshotNotFoundException` will be raised.

### 2. Timing Issues

Another possible cause of the `SnapshotNotFoundException` is the timing aspect. When dealing with snapshots, it is essential to consider the time taken for the snapshot to be fully registered or propagated across the AWS Memory DB cluster.

For instance, suppose you delete a snapshot and almost immediately attempt an operation with that snapshot. In that case, the AWS Memory DB cluster may not recognize the snapshot deletion immediately, leading to the `SnapshotNotFoundException`.

Therefore, it is recommended to introduce a delay or implement a wait mechanism after deleting or creating snapshots to ensure they are properly registered within the cluster.

## Handling SnapshotNotFoundException

Now that we understand the potential causes of the `SnapshotNotFoundException`, let's explore some best practices for handling this exception effectively.

### 1. Verify Snapshot Identifier

The initial step for handling this exception is to verify the snapshot identifier. Ensure that the snapshot identifier is correctly specified, matches the desired snapshot, and is associated with the intended AWS Memory DB cluster.

To mitigate incorrect identifier-related issues, it is advisable to double-check the snapshot identifier before executing operations with snapshots. Implementing additional input validation or using AWS SDK methods to list available snapshots and their associated cluster information can help with verification.

### 2. Implement Retry Mechanism

Due to timing issues, the immediate execution of operations, such as restore or delete, after creating or deleting snapshots can result in the `SnapshotNotFoundException`. To avoid such issues, it is wise to implement a retry mechanism that introduces a delay or waits for a certain period before executing the operation.

By providing a timed delay, you allow the system to propagate the snapshot-related changes across the AWS Memory DB cluster, minimizing the chances of encountering the `SnapshotNotFoundException`.

Consider the following example, which demonstrates a basic retry mechanism:

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.memorydb.AmazonMemoryDB;
import com.amazonaws.services.memorydb.AmazonMemoryDBClientBuilder;
import com.amazonaws.services.memorydb.model.RestoreSnapshotRequest;

public class MemoryDBExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AmazonMemoryDB client = AmazonMemoryDBClientBuilder.defaultClient();
        
        String snapshotIdentifier = "snapshot-12345"; // Correct identifier
        
        RestoreSnapshotRequest request = new RestoreSnapshotRequest()
            .withSnapshotName(snapshotIdentifier)
            .withClusterName("my-cluster");
        
        int maxAttempts = 5;
        int waitTimeInSeconds = 10;
        
        for (int attempt = 1; attempt <= maxAttempts; attempt++) {
            try {
                client.restoreSnapshot(request);
                break; // Successfully restored the snapshot, exit the loop
            } catch (com.amazonaws.services.memorydb.model.SnapshotNotFoundException ex) {
                if (attempt >= maxAttempts) {
                    System.out.println("Could not find the snapshot even after retries. Please check the snapshot identifier.");
                } else {
                    System.out.println("Snapshot not found. Retrying in " + waitTimeInSeconds + " seconds.");
                    try {
                        Thread.sleep(waitTimeInSeconds * 1000);
                    } catch (InterruptedException interruptedEx) {
                        // Handle interruption
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example, the code attempts to restore the desired snapshot, but it includes a retry mechanism. The loop tries to restore the snapshot for a maximum number of attempts, introducing a delay of 10 seconds between each attempt. If the snapshot is still not found after the maximum attempts, an appropriate message is printed.

By implementing such retry logic, you give the snapshot enough time to become available within the AWS Memory DB cluster, reducing the chances of encountering the `SnapshotNotFoundException`.

## Conclusion

The `SnapshotNotFoundException` can occur while working with snapshots in AWS Memory DB. By understanding its causes and implementing appropriate handling techniques, you can effectively manage and troubleshoot this exception. Remember to verify the snapshot identifier and consider implementing a retry mechanism to handle timing-related issues.

AWS provides official documentation for [AWS Memory DB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/memorydb/latest/developerguide/what-is.html), where you can find more details about the service and its various exceptions.

Next time you encounter the `SnapshotNotFoundException`, you will be well-equipped to swiftly identify and resolve the issue, ensuring the smooth functioning of your AWS Memory DB operations.

Happy coding!
