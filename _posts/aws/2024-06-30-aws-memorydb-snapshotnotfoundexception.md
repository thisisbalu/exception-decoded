Have you ever encountered the *SnapshotNotFoundException* while working with AWS Memory DB? In this comprehensive guide, we will dive deep into this exception and discuss everything you need to know about it. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced AWS developer, this article will provide valuable insights into handling this exception effectively.

## Understanding SnapshotNotFoundException

The *SnapshotNotFoundException* is an error that occurs when the requested snapshot does not exist in the AWS Memory DB cluster. This exception is specific to the `com.amazonaws.services.memorydb.model` package in the AWS SDK for Java.

## Common Causes of SnapshotNotFoundException

Let's explore the common causes that can lead to the *SnapshotNotFoundException*:

1. **Invalid snapshot identifier**: Ensure that you are providing a valid snapshot identifier to retrieve the snapshot. If the snapshot does not exist or the identifier is incorrect, the exception will be thrown.

2. **Asynchronous snapshot creation**: When creating a snapshot, AWS Memory DB performs the operation asynchronously. If you try to access the snapshot immediately after triggering the creation, it may not be available yet. Make sure to wait for the snapshot to be complete before attempting to access it.

3. **Deletion of the snapshot**: If a snapshot is deleted, it becomes inaccessible. Trying to access a deleted snapshot will result in the *SnapshotNotFoundException*.

## Handling the SnapshotNotFoundException

To effectively handle the *SnapshotNotFoundException*, follow these best practices:

### 1. Validate the snapshot identifier

Before making any request to retrieve a snapshot, validate the snapshot identifier. You can use the `describeSnapshots` method to check if the snapshot exists. Here's an example:

```java
DescribeSnapshotsRequest describeSnapshotsRequest = new DescribeSnapshotsRequest()
        .withSnapshotName(snapshotIdentifier);
        
DescribeSnapshotsResult describeSnapshotsResult = memoryDbClient.describeSnapshots(describeSnapshotsRequest);

List<Snapshot> snapshots = describeSnapshotsResult.getSnapshots();
if (snapshots.isEmpty()) {
    throw new SnapshotNotFoundException("Snapshot not found: " + snapshotIdentifier);
}
```

### 2. Retry mechanism

If you encounter the *SnapshotNotFoundException* due to asynchronous snapshot creation, consider implementing a retry mechanism. Poll the `describeSnapshots` API at regular intervals until the snapshot is available.

```java
boolean snapshotAvailable = false;
while (!snapshotAvailable) {
    try {
        Thread.sleep(1000); // Delay between retries
        describeSnapshotsResult = memoryDbClient.describeSnapshots(describeSnapshotsRequest);
        snapshots = describeSnapshotsResult.getSnapshots();
        if (!snapshots.isEmpty()) {
            snapshotAvailable = true;
        }
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        throw new RuntimeException("Interrupted during snapshot retrieval");
    }
}

// Continue with snapshot retrieval logic
```

### 3. Error handling

Wrap the snapshot retrieval logic within a try-catch block to handle the *SnapshotNotFoundException* appropriately. Take necessary actions such as logging the error or notifying the user when the exception occurs.

```java
try {
    DescribeSnapshotsResult describeSnapshotsResult = memoryDbClient.describeSnapshots(describeSnapshotsRequest);
    // Process the snapshots
} catch (SnapshotNotFoundException e) {
    // Handle the exception
    logger.error("Snapshot not found: " + snapshotIdentifier);
    // Optional: Notify the user or perform alternative operations
}
```

## Conclusion

The *SnapshotNotFoundException* in AWS Memory DB can occur when trying to access a non-existent or deleted snapshot. By implementing the best practices mentioned in this article, you can effectively handle this exception and ensure smooth operation within your applications.

Remember to validate the snapshot identifier, implement a retry mechanism for asynchronous snapshot creation, and handle the exception with appropriate error handling techniques.
