Introduction:
The AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully managed container registry service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows developers to store, manage, and deploy containers seamlessly. However, while working with ECR, you may encounter an UploadNotFoundException thrown by the `com.amazonaws.services.ecr.model` package. In this article, we will explore what this exception is, common causes for its occurrence, and how to handle it effectively.

---

## What is UploadNotFoundException?
The `com.amazonaws.services.ecr.model.UploadNotFoundException` is an exception that occurs when an upload is not found in the AWS Elastic Container Registry.

This exception is usually thrown when attempting to complete, initiate, or describe an image upload process in ECR, but the specified upload is not found. It signifies that the upload has either expired or been deleted.

---

## Possible Causes for UploadNotFoundException
There are several reasons why this exception may occur. Here are some common causes to consider:

1. Expired or Deleted Upload: The upload may have expired or been manually deleted resulting in the UploadNotFoundException. The ECR service retains image upload information for only 48 hours by default.

2. Incorrect Upload Identifier: The specified upload identifier might be incorrect, leading to the exception. Ensure that you are providing the correct upload identifier when interacting with ECR APIs.

3. Delayed Eventual Consistency: ECR leverages eventual consistency, which means that it can take some time for changes made to the registry to propagate. If you initiate or complete an upload and immediately try to interact with it, the upload may not be available yet. Wait for a short duration before attempting any further operations.

## Handling UploadNotFoundException

To effectively handle the UploadNotFoundException and ensure smooth execution of your application, consider the following steps:

1. Validate Upload Identifier: Before performing any operations related to the upload, validate the upload identifier. You can use the `com.amazonaws.services.ecr.AmazonECR.describeImageUpload()` method to verify the existence of the upload and retrieve its details.

   ```java
   try {
       DescribeImageUploadsRequest describeRequest = new DescribeImageUploadsRequest().withRegistryId("1234567890").withUploadIds("uploadId");
       DescribeImageUploadsResult describeResult = ecrClient.describeImageUploads(describeRequest);
       // Retrieve upload information and handle accordingly
   } catch (UploadNotFoundException ex) {
       // Handle exception appropriately
   }
   ```

2. Retry or Terminate: If the upload is not found, you can choose to retry the operation after a certain interval. However, it is essential to have a maximum retry count to avoid endless retries. Alternatively, you can terminate the process gracefully and inform the user about the missing upload.

   ```java
   int maxRetries = 3;
   int retryCount = 0;
   boolean uploadFound = false;

   while (!uploadFound && retryCount < maxRetries) {
       try {
           // Perform upload-related operations
           uploadFound = true;
       } catch (UploadNotFoundException ex) {
           retryCount++;
           // Sleep for a specified interval before retrying
           Thread.sleep(2000); 
       }
   }

   if (!uploadFound) {
       // Terminate process and inform user about the missing upload
   }
   ```

3. Proper Exception Handling: Handle the UploadNotFoundException specifically in your code by catching the exception and executing appropriate error handling routines.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the UploadNotFoundException of com.amazonaws.services.ecr.model in AWS Elastic Container Registry is thrown when an upload is not found. We have explored common causes for this exception, such as expired or deleted uploads, incorrect upload identifiers, and delayed eventual consistency. To handle this exception effectively, validate the upload identifier, retry or terminate the process, and handle the exception gracefully.

By understanding and addressing the UploadNotFoundException, you can seamlessly work with uploads in the AWS Elastic Container Registry. For more information, refer to the official AWS documentation on [ECR Model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/ecr/model/UploadNotFoundException.html).

Remember to implement error handling best practices, validate user inputs, and plan for potential exceptions to ensure the smooth functioning of your application.
