## Introduction

Are you encountering the `DBUpgradeDependencyFailureException` error while using Amazon DocumentDB? Don't worry; you're not alone. In this article, we'll explore this exception in detail and learn how to troubleshoot and resolve it effectively.

## What is DBUpgradeDependencyFailureException?

The `DBUpgradeDependencyFailureException` is an exception thrown by the `com.amazonaws.services.docdb.model` API in Amazon DocumentDB. It indicates that an attempt to modify the DB cluster failed due to an unresolved upgrade dependency.

## Understanding the Exception

When you attempt to modify an Amazon DocumentDB cluster, such as upgrading the underlying engine version or modifying the cluster parameters, Amazon DocumentDB first checks for any upgrade dependencies. These dependencies ensure that the modification can be applied without disrupting the cluster's stability and availability.

If there are any unresolved dependencies, the `DBUpgradeDependencyFailureException` is thrown, preventing the modification from proceeding. This is a safety mechanism to prevent unforeseen issues that may arise from unsupported configurations or incomplete upgrades.

## Common Scenarios

Let's explore a couple of common scenarios that can trigger the `DBUpgradeDependencyFailureException`:

### 1. Pending Cluster Modifications

If there are any pending modifications to the cluster, such as a previous upgrade or parameter change that hasn't completed, you won't be able to initiate further modifications until the pending changes are finished. Attempting to modify the cluster while these changes are still pending will result in the exception being thrown.

### 2. Minor Version Upgrade Incompatibilities

In some cases, a minor version upgrade may introduce incompatibilities with certain options or configurations. Amazon DocumentDB ensures that all compatibility issues are addressed before allowing any modifications to proceed. If there are any known incompatibilities with the selected upgrade version, the exception will be thrown.

## Resolving DBUpgradeDependencyFailureException

To resolve the `DBUpgradeDependencyFailureException`, follow these steps:

1. Identify the pending modifications: Check for any pending modifications on the cluster by calling the `describeDBClusters` API. Look for any modifications with a status of `applying` or `pending`.

```java
DescribeDBClustersRequest describeRequest = new DescribeDBClustersRequest()
  .withDBClusterIdentifier(clusterIdentifier);

DescribeDBClustersResult describeResult = docDBClient.describeDBClusters(describeRequest);

List<DBCluster> clusters = describeResult.getDBClusters();

for (DBCluster cluster : clusters) {
  List<DBClusterPendingModifiedValues> pendingModifications = cluster.getPendingModifiedValues();

  if (!pendingModifications.isEmpty()) {
    // Handle pending modifications
  }
}
```

2. Wait for pending modifications to complete: If you find any pending modifications, wait for them to complete before attempting any further modifications. Controlling the modification sequence is crucial to ensure stability and avoid unexpected issues. You can use a loop with a delay to periodically check the status until the modifications are finished.

```java
while (true) {
  Thread.sleep(10000); // Wait for 10 seconds
  
  DescribeDBClustersResult result = docDBClient.describeDBClusters(describeRequest);
  List<DBCluster> clusters = result.getDBClusters();
  
  for (DBCluster cluster : clusters) {
    List<DBClusterPendingModifiedValues> pendingModifications = cluster.getPendingModifiedValues();
    
    if (pendingModifications.isEmpty()) {
      // All modifications completed
      return;
    }
  }
}
```

3. Check compatibility with the desired version: If you encounter the exception while attempting a version upgrade, ensure that the selected upgrade version doesn't have any known incompatibilities. Check the [Amazon DocumentDB User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/compatibility.html) for more details on version compatibility.

4. Retry the modification: Once all the pending modifications are completed, you can retry the modification that triggered the `DBUpgradeDependencyFailureException`. Ensure that the modifications are in line with the guidelines provided by the Amazon DocumentDB User Guide.

## Conclusion

In this article, we've explored the `DBUpgradeDependencyFailureException` in Amazon DocumentDB. We've understood what it means, its common scenarios, and steps to resolve it. By following the troubleshooting steps mentioned here, you'll be able to smoothly manage modifications and upgrades to your Amazon DocumentDB cluster.

Remember to keep an eye on any pending modifications and ensure version upgrade compatibility to avoid encountering this exception. For further details, refer to the [Amazon DocumentDB API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/APIReference/Home.html).

Happy clustering with Amazon DocumentDB!
