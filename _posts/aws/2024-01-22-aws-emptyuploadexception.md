## Introduction
In the world of AWS ECR Public, developers often encounter various exceptions while working with the service. One such exception is the EmptyUploadException, which can be puzzling for beginners. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the depths of EmptyUploadException in com.amazonaws.services.ecrpublic.model and explore its causes, solutions, and best practices for handling it effectively. So, let's get started!

## Understanding EmptyUploadException
EmptyUploadException is thrown when attempting to interact with Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) Public where the request specifies an empty upload ID. This exception signifies that no upload is in progress for that specific resource.

## Causes of EmptyUploadException

When does EmptyUploadException occur? This exception can be triggered due to various reasons, some of which include:

1. **Missing or incorrect upload ID**: The most common cause of this exception is supplying an invalid upload ID. Ensure that the upload ID is correctly provided while interacting with ECR Public APIs.

2. **Expired or completed upload**: If an upload is expired or has already been completed, attempting to perform operations on it may result in an EmptyUploadException.

## Handling EmptyUploadException

To handle EmptyUploadException effectively, follow these best practices:

1. **Catch and handle the exception**: Enclose the ECR Public API calls that may cause an EmptyUploadException within a try-catch block. This way, you can gracefully handle the exception and prevent application crashes.

```java
try {
    // ECR Public API operations
} catch (EmptyUploadException e) {
    // Handle the exception
    // Print an error message or log the exception
}
```

2. **Check the upload ID**: Before making any API calls that require an upload ID, validate that the supplied upload ID is not empty or null.

```java
// Get the upload ID from the request
String uploadId = "XYZ123";

// Validate the upload ID
if (StringUtils.isNullOrEmpty(uploadId)) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid upload ID");
}
```

3. **Verify the upload status**: To avoid encountering an EmptyUploadException, ensure that the upload is still active before performing any further actions. You can use the `DescribeImageScanFindings` API to check the status of the upload.

```java
// Get the upload ID from the request
String uploadId = "XYZ123";

// Check the upload status
DescribeImageScanFindingsRequest request = new DescribeImageScanFindingsRequest()
                .withRegistryId("<your-registry-id>")
                .withRepositoryName("<your-repository-name>")
                .withImageId(new ImageIdentifier().withImageDigest("<your-image-digest>"))
                .withImageScanStatuses(ImageScanStatus.IN_PROGRESS);

DescribeImageScanFindingsResult result = ecrPublicClient.describeImageScanFindings(request);

// Check if the upload is still active
if (result.getImageScanStatuses().isEmpty()) {
    throw new EmptyUploadException("The upload is empty or not in progress");
}
```

## Conclusion
Handling EmptyUploadException efficiently is vital to ensure smooth interactions with AWS ECR Public. By understanding the causes and implementing the provided best practices, developers can overcome this exception and build robust ECR Public applications.

Keep in mind that this article only scratches the surface of EmptyUploadException. For more detailed information, refer to the official [AWS ECR Public API documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ecr-public/latest/APIReference/).

Now that you are equipped with the knowledge of EmptyUploadException, you can confidently handle it and take full advantage of AWS ECR Public's powerful features.

Happy coding!
