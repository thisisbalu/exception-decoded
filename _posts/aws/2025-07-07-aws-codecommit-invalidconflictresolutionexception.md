AWS CodeCommit is a fully managed source control service that makes it easy for teams to host secure and scalable Git repositories. While working with CodeCommit, developers may encounter various exceptions that can impede their workflow. One such exception is `InvalidConflictResolutionException`. In this article, we will dive deep into this exception, its causes, and how to handle it effectively. We will also look at examples to illustrate the concepts better.

## What is InvalidConflictResolutionException?

The `InvalidConflictResolutionException` is a specific exception thrown by AWS CodeCommit when there is an issue during the conflict resolution process of a merge operation. This typically stems from an invalid or unrecognized `mergeOption` or `conflictResolution` object passed during the merge request.

## Common Causes of InvalidConflictResolutionException

This exception can occur due to several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Merge Option**: Specifying an invalid merge option that does not conform to the allowed values.
2. **Invalid Conflict Resolution Strategy**: Passing a malformed or unsupported conflict resolution strategy that CodeCommit cannot process.
3. **Missing Required Parameters**: Not providing necessary attributes in the conflict resolution request.

## How to Handle InvalidConflictResolutionException

To effectively handle this exception, developers need to:

1. **Review Merge Options**: Ensure the `mergeOption` provided in the merge request is either `FAST_FORWARD_MERGE` or `SQUASH_MERGE`.
2. **Validate Conflict Resolution Object**: Ensure that the `ConflictResolution` object is correctly structured and contains valid data.
3. **Capture Exception Details**: Use try-catch blocks to capture this exception and log its details for debugging.

## Example of Encountering InvalidConflictResolutionException

Let’s take an example to highlight how you might encounter this exception. Below is a simple code snippet that attempts to merge two branches in a CodeCommit repository.

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.AWSCodeCommit;
import com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.AWSCodeCommitClientBuilder;
import com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.model.MergeRepositoriesRequest;
import com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.model.InvalidConflictResolutionException;

public class CodeCommitMergeExample {
    private static final String REPOSITORY_NAME = "YourRepoName";
    private static final String SOURCE_BRANCH = "source-branch";
    private static final String DESTINATION_BRANCH = "destination-branch";

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AWSCodeCommit codeCommitClient = AWSCodeCommitClientBuilder.defaultClient();

        try {
            MergeRepositoriesRequest mergeRequest = new MergeRepositoriesRequest()
                .withDestinationCommitSpecifier(DESTINATION_BRANCH)
                .withSourceCommitSpecifier(SOURCE_BRANCH)
                .withConflictResolution(null); // Incorrectly null

            codeCommitClient.mergeRepositories(mergeRequest);
        } catch (InvalidConflictResolutionException e) {
            System.out.println("Encountered InvalidConflictResolutionException: " + e.getMessage());
            // Additional logging or error handling here
        }
    }
}
```

### Fixing the Example

In the above example, we have set the `ConflictResolution` to null, which is incorrect. Here’s how to resolve the issue:

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.model.ConflictResolution;

public static void main(String[] args) {
    ...
    try {
        ConflictResolution conflictResolution = new ConflictResolution()
            .withStrategy("AUTOMERGE")
            .withConflictedFiles(new HashMap<>()); // Update this map with actual conflict data

        MergeRepositoriesRequest mergeRequest = new MergeRepositoriesRequest()
            .withDestinationCommitSpecifier(DESTINATION_BRANCH)
            .withSourceCommitSpecifier(SOURCE_BRANCH)
            .withConflictResolution(conflictResolution);

        codeCommitClient.mergeRepositories(mergeRequest);
    } catch (InvalidConflictResolutionException e) {
        System.out.println("Encountered InvalidConflictResolutionException: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

### Best Practices for Avoiding InvalidConflictResolutionException

1. **Use SDK Documentation**: Always refer to the AWS SDK documentation for the correct structure and available options for the merge request.
2. **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests to validate various scenarios of conflict resolution handling in your application.
3. **Logging**: Implement logging for all exceptions, especially those related to AWS service interactions, for better debugging in production.

## Conclusion

The `InvalidConflictResolutionException` in AWS CodeCommit can be frustrating, but understanding its causes and how to handle it can save developers a lot of time. By ensuring proper values for `mergeOption` and adequately structuring the `ConflictResolution` object, you can smooth out the merge process in your CodeCommit workflows. By incorporating best practices, such as thorough testing and logging, developers can further minimize the impact of such exceptions.
