In the age of collaboration and version control, AWS CodeCommit stands out as a robust tool for managing Git repositories. However, like any other software, it comes with its own set of challenges. One such challenge developers may encounter is the `InvalidConflictResolutionException`. Understanding this exception and how to handle it effectively is crucial for maintaining a smooth development workflow. In this article, we dive deep into what `InvalidConflictResolutionException` is, the scenarios under which it arises, and how to efficiently deal with it.

## What is InvalidConflictResolutionException?

`InvalidConflictResolutionException` is an error that occurs in AWS CodeCommit when there is a conflict in attempting to resolve a merge or during pull operations. This exception typically arises when the developer attempts to reconcile changes between branches that have conflicts. This conflict might stem from various situations like edits made to the same line, deletion of a file that has undergone changes in another branch, or even consuming resources that have different states.

The exception conveys that the attempted resolution cannot be applied due to invalid operations or conflicting changes. Essentially, it signals to the developer that some manual intervention is required to resolve the conflict.

## Common Scenarios Leading to InvalidConflictResolutionException

Here are a few scenarios where you might encounter the `InvalidConflictResolutionException`:

1. **Simultaneous Changes**: Two developers work on the same line of code in different branches and try to merge their changes into a common branch.

2. **Deleted Files**: A file has been deleted in one branch while undergoing changes in another. Attempting to merge both branches leads to confusion for the system regarding which version to keep.

3. **Incorrect Merge Strategies**: Using incorrect merge strategies while trying to resolve conflicts can result in this exception.

## Handling InvalidConflictResolutionException

To effectively resolve `InvalidConflictResolutionException`, developers can follow several strategies. Below are detailed code examples and approaches to handle conflicts.

### Step 1: Updating Your Local Repository

Before attempting to merge or pull changes, ensure your local repository is up to date with the latest changes from the remote repository.

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout your-branch
git merge origin/target-branch
```

### Step 2: Checking for Conflicts

Another crucial step is to check for merge conflicts after attempting a pull or merge operation. This can be done using:

```bash
git status
```

If there are conflicts, Git will highlight the affected files. Open these files and examine the conflicting sections marked by `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`.

### Step 3: Resolving Conflicts Manually

Manually resolve the conflicts in a text editor or a merge tool. After resolving, mark the conflicts as resolved:

```bash
git add path/to/resolved-file
```

Finally, commit your changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
```

### Step 4: Handling Programmatically Using AWS SDK

In scenarios where you are using the AWS SDK for Java to interact with CodeCommit, you might encounter `InvalidConflictResolutionException` when dealing with conflicts programmatically. Here’s how to handle it.

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.AWSCodeCommit;
import com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.AWSCodeCommitClientBuilder;
import com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.model.InvalidConflictResolutionException;
import com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.model.MergePullRequestBySquashRequest;

public class CodeCommitExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AWSCodeCommit codeCommitClient = AWSCodeCommitClientBuilder.defaultClient();
        
        try {
            MergePullRequestBySquashRequest request = new MergePullRequestBySquashRequest()
                .withPullRequestId("your-pull-request-id")
                .withTargetBranch("your-target-branch");
            
            codeCommitClient.mergePullRequestBySquash(request);
        } catch (InvalidConflictResolutionException e) {
            System.err.println("Conflict resolution is invalid: " + e.getMessage());
            // Implement your conflict resolution logic here
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, if a conflict occurs, the exception can be caught, allowing developers to handle conflicts programmatically—possibly by implementing custom logic to resolve conflicts based on specific requirements.

### Step 5: Leveraging Code Review

Encouraging peer code reviews can also mitigate potential discrepancies that lead to conflicts. Using CodeCommit’s built-in features for pull requests allows you to review code changes before merging, providing clarity and preventing invalid merges.

### Step 6: Utilizing AWS CodeCommit Notification

You can set up notifications to alert you about changes in CodeCommit repositories, reducing your chances of encountering `InvalidConflictResolutionException` due to unaware simultaneous changes.

## Conclusion

The `InvalidConflictResolutionException` in AWS CodeCommit can surface due to various reasons, primarily related to conflicting changes across branches. By understanding how conflicts arise and the steps to resolve them, developers can ensure smoother collaboration and version control. 

Always keep your local repositories up to date, frequently communicate with your team during the development cycle, and leverage tools and best practices to manage merge conflicts effectively. With these strategies, you can handle `InvalidConflictResolutionException` confidently, leading to a more productive development experience.
