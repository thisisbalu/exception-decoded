## Introduction

AWS CloudFront is a powerful content delivery network (CDN) service that helps businesses deliver their content with low latency and high throughput. However, there can be instances when you encounter errors while configuring your CloudFront distributions.

One such error is the **TooManyDistributionCNAMEsException**, which occurs when you exceed the maximum number of CNAMEs (Canonical Names) allowed for a CloudFront distribution. In this article, we will dive deep into this exception, explore its underlying causes, discuss troubleshooting techniques, and offer solutions to resolve this issue effectively.

## What is TooManyDistributionCNAMEsException?

The **TooManyDistributionCNAMEsException** is an exception thrown by the **com.amazonaws.services.cloudfront.model** class in AWS SDK when you attempt to add more CNAMEs to your CloudFront distribution than the maximum limit allows. CNAMEs are alternative domain names that you can associate with your CloudFront distribution.

By default, each CloudFront distribution can have up to 10 CNAMEs associated with it. However, if you try to add more than that, the **TooManyDistributionCNAMEsException** is raised.

This exception is important to understand as it can hinder your ability to properly configure your CloudFront distributions, potentially causing issues with your website's availability and performance.

## Causes of TooManyDistributionCNAMEsException

When you encounter the **TooManyDistributionCNAMEsException**, it is crucial to investigate the underlying causes in order to resolve the issue effectively. Here are some common causes:

### 1. Exceeding the maximum CNAME limit

As mentioned earlier, each CloudFront distribution has a default limit of 10 CNAMEs. If you exceed this limit, the exception is raised, and you will be unable to add additional CNAMEs until the limit is resolved.

### 2. Insufficient distribution planning

Improper planning of your CloudFront distributions can also lead to exceeding the CNAME limit. If you have multiple domains or subdomains that require individual CNAMEs, it is crucial to strategize and prioritize which CNAMEs are necessary for your business.

### 3. Incorrect usage of CloudFront features

Misconfiguration or misuse of CloudFront features, such as Alternate Domain Names (ADNs) or custom SSL/TLS certificates, can also result in triggering the **TooManyDistributionCNAMEsException**. It is important to ensure that you are correctly utilizing these features and not unnecessarily adding CNAMEs.

## Troubleshooting TooManyDistributionCNAMEsException

When faced with the **TooManyDistributionCNAMEsException**, it is essential to follow a systematic approach to identify and troubleshoot the issue. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this exception:

### 1. Review your CNAME usage 

Analyze your CloudFront distribution configurations and verify the number of CNAMEs associated with each distribution. Remove any unnecessary or redundant CNAMEs that are not crucial for your business operations. Prioritizing CNAME usage can help ensure you stay within the limits.

### 2. Check for misconfigurations

Inspect your CloudFront settings for any misconfigurations related to ADNs or custom SSL/TLS certificates. Make sure you are not adding unnecessary CNAMEs due to incorrect configurations. Correct any misconfigurations found and verify if the exception is still raised.

### 3. Monitor and optimize

Implement monitoring and optimization strategies to track your CloudFront distribution's performance and identify potential areas for improvement. Utilize AWS CloudWatch metrics and logs to gain insights into your distribution's behavior and make necessary changes to optimize your CNAME usage.

## Resolving TooManyDistributionCNAMEsException

To effectively resolve the **TooManyDistributionCNAMEsException**, consider the following solutions and best practices:

### 1. Consolidate CNAMEs

Ensure that you are making the most out of your available CNAMEs by consolidating multiple domain or subdomain endpoints into a single CNAME. This way, you can maximize the number of unique CNAMEs utilized within the distribution.

### 2. Reevaluate distribution design

If you consistently encounter the CNAME limit, reevaluate your distribution design. Assess the necessity of each domain or subdomain and prioritize the most important ones. Consider combining multiple distributions into a single distribution if it aligns with your business requirements.

### 3. Leverage wildcard CNAMEs

Another option is to utilize wildcard CNAMEs. A wildcard CNAME can handle requests for multiple subdomains, reducing the need for individual CNAMEs. If your business requirement allows for wildcard usage, this can save you valuable CNAME slots.

### 4. Use AWS Lambda@Edge

Leverage AWS Lambda@Edge to dynamically handle incoming requests based on the incoming host header. This way, you can reduce the need for individual CNAMEs for different domains or subdomains. Lambda@Edge enables you to customize your distribution's behavior without adding more CNAMEs.

## Conclusion

The **TooManyDistributionCNAMEsException** can be a challenging error to encounter when working with AWS CloudFront distributions. By understanding the causes, troubleshooting techniques, and effective solutions mentioned in this article, you can better address this exception and ensure optimal configuration of your CloudFront distributions.

Remember to regularly monitor your CNAME usage and distribution configurations to avoid surpassing the maximum limit and potentially impacting your website's availability and performance. Following best practices and utilizing the recommended solutions can help you make the most out of your CloudFront distribution while keeping potential issues at bay.
