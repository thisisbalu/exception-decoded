Amazon DocumentDB is a fully managed, scalable, and highly available document database service designed to work with JSON data. As with any cloud service, developers may encounter different exceptions when integrating with the Amazon DocumentDB APIs. One such exception is `ResourceNotFoundException`. In this article, we will explore this exception in detail, discuss its causes, and provide practical code examples on how to handle it effectively.

## What is ResourceNotFoundException?

`ResourceNotFoundException` is a runtime exception in the AWS SDK for Java that is thrown when a requested resource cannot be found. In the context of Amazon DocumentDB, this often pertains to various resources such as database clusters, instances, or any entity that needs to be accessed via the API.

### Common Causes of ResourceNotFoundException

1. **Incorrect Resource Identifier**: The most common cause is an invalid or non-existent resource identifier (e.g., cluster ID or database name).
2. **Resource Not Available**: The resource may have been deleted, or it might not yet be fully provisioned.
3. **Incorrect Region**: Attempting to access a resource in the wrong AWS region can also result in this exception.
4. **Permissions Issues**: Insufficient IAM permissions can sometimes lead to resources being inaccessible, though this usually leads to different error codes.

## Handling ResourceNotFoundException

It is crucial for developers to implement robust error handling to provide a seamless experience when using Amazon DocumentDB. The following code snippets illustrate how to handle `ResourceNotFoundException`.

### Setting Up the AWS SDK for Java

Before we proceed with code examples, make sure you have the AWS SDK for Java as a dependency in your project. If you're using Maven, include the following in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.amazonaws</groupId>
    <artifactId>aws-java-sdk-docdbelastic</artifactId>
    <version>1.12.300</version> <!-- Use the latest version -->
</dependency>
```

### Example 1: Fetching a DocumentDB Cluster

In the below example, we'll attempt to fetch a DocumentDB cluster by its ID. If the cluster does not exist, we’ll catch the `ResourceNotFoundException`.

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.docdbelastic.AmazonDocDBElastic;
import com.amazonaws.services.docdbelastic.AmazonDocDBElasticClientBuilder;
import com.amazonaws.services.docdbelastic.model.GetClusterRequest;
import com.amazonaws.services.docdbelastic.model.ResourceNotFoundException;

public class DocumentDBExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AmazonDocDBElastic docDBElastic = AmazonDocDBElasticClientBuilder.defaultClient();

        String clusterId = "your-cluster-id"; // Replace with your cluster ID
        GetClusterRequest request = new GetClusterRequest().withClusterId(clusterId);

        try {
            // Fetch the DocumentDB cluster
            docDBElastic.getCluster(request);
            System.out.println("Cluster found: " + clusterId);
        } catch (ResourceNotFoundException e) {
            System.err.println("Cluster not found: " + clusterId);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### Example 2: Deleting a DocumentDB Cluster

When deleting a cluster, you may want to verify whether the cluster exists before attempting the deletion. Here’s how you can handle that scenario:

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.docdbelastic.model.DeleteClusterRequest;

public class DeleteClusterExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AmazonDocDBElastic docDBElastic = AmazonDocDBElasticClientBuilder.defaultClient();

        String clusterId = "your-cluster-id"; // Replace with your cluster ID
        DeleteClusterRequest deleteRequest = new DeleteClusterRequest().withClusterId(clusterId);

        try {
            // Attempt to delete the DocumentDB cluster
            docDBElastic.deleteCluster(deleteRequest);
            System.out.println("Cluster deleted successfully: " + clusterId);
        } catch (ResourceNotFoundException e) {
            System.err.println("Cluster not found, could not delete: " + clusterId);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### Example 3: Retrieving Available Instances

You may also want to list available instances and handle cases where a requested instance does not exist.

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.docdbelastic.model.ListClustersRequest;

public class ListClustersExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AmazonDocDBElastic docDBElastic = AmazonDocDBElasticClientBuilder.defaultClient();
       
        try {
            // Listing all clusters
            docDBElastic.listClusters(new ListClustersRequest()).getClusters().forEach(cluster -> {
                System.out.println("Found cluster: " + cluster.getClusterId());
            });
        } catch (ResourceNotFoundException e) {
            System.err.println("No clusters found.");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### Best Practices for Handling ResourceNotFoundException

1. **Graceful Degradation**: Implement fallbacks or user notifications if a resource is not found.
2. **Retry Logic**: Implement retries, especially for transient errors that lead to resources being temporarily inaccessible.
3. **Detailed Logging**: Log detailed errors for easier debugging and tracing issues back to their source.

## Conclusion

Handling exceptions like `ResourceNotFoundException` is an essential part of developing robust applications that interact with Amazon DocumentDB. By implementing best practices and utilizing the code examples provided, developers can ensure a more stable and user-friendly experience. As you continue to work with AWS services, remember to keep an eye on your resource management practices to avoid common pitfalls.
