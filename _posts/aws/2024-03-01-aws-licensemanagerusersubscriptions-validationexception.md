## Introduction to AWS License Manager User Subscriptions

AWS License Manager provides a centralized solution for managing licenses from software vendors across AWS accounts and on-premises resources. This service enables you to track, manage, and distribute licenses, making it easier to maintain compliance with software licensing agreements.

AWS License Manager User Subscriptions is an essential part of the AWS License Manager ecosystem. It lets you manage user access to license entitlements by allowing or denying individual subscriptions for each user. The `com.amazonaws.services.licensemanagerusersubscriptions.model` package contains various classes that facilitate interaction with User Subscriptions.

In this article, we'll focus on the `ValidationException` class within this package.

## Understanding the ValidationException class

### What is a ValidationException and how does it work?

The `ValidationException` class is an exception that can be raised when an input parameter provided to an AWS License Manager User Subscriptions operation fails validation rules. This exception is thrown to indicate that an input parameter didn't meet the criteria defined by the service.

In simpler terms, this exception is triggered when one or more values provided to an operation violate the validation rules set by AWS License Manager User Subscriptions. It serves as a prompt for developers to review their input and make necessary adjustments to meet the defined standards.

### Code examples demonstrating ValidationException usage

To better understand the usage of the `ValidationException` class, let's take a look at some code examples. Here, we will explore two scenarios where this exception might be raised.

In this first example, we create a user subscription using the `createLicenseManagerUserSubscription` method. If the `accountId` provided is invalid, a `ValidationException` will be thrown.

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.licensemanagerusersubscriptions.*;
import com.amazonaws.services.licensemanagerusersubscriptions.model.*;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AWSLicenseManagerUserSubscriptions client = AWSLicenseManagerUserSubscriptionsClientBuilder.defaultClient();
        
        try {
            CreateLicenseManagerUserSubscriptionRequest request = new CreateLicenseManagerUserSubscriptionRequest()
                .withAccountId("invalid_account_id")
                .withLicenseManagerUserProfileArn("arn:aws:iam::012345678910:user/user1");
                
            CreateLicenseManagerUserSubscriptionResult result = client.createLicenseManagerUserSubscription(request);
        } catch (ValidationException e) {
            System.out.println("ValidationException: An invalid Account ID was provided.");
        }
    }
}
```

In the second example, we update a user subscription using the `updateLicenseManagerUserSubscription` method. Here, if the `subscriptionId` provided is empty or null, a `ValidationException` will be thrown.

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.licensemanagerusersubscriptions.*;
import com.amazonaws.services.licensemanagerusersubscriptions.model.*;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AWSLicenseManagerUserSubscriptions client = AWSLicenseManagerUserSubscriptionsClientBuilder.defaultClient();
        
        try {
            UpdateLicenseManagerUserSubscriptionRequest request = new UpdateLicenseManagerUserSubscriptionRequest()
                .withSubscriptionId("")
                .withLicenseManagerUserProfileArn("arn:aws:iam::012345678910:user/user2");
                
            UpdateLicenseManagerUserSubscriptionResult result = client.updateLicenseManagerUserSubscription(request);
        } catch (ValidationException e) {
            System.out.println("ValidationException: The Subscription ID cannot be empty.");
        }
    }
}
```

These code examples demonstrate how the `ValidationException` class can be used to handle and respond to invalid input parameters.

## How to handle and prevent ValidationExceptions

Now that we understand how the `ValidationException` can be thrown, let's explore best practices for handling and preventing such exceptions.

### Best practices for error handling and mitigation

1. **Validate inputs client-side:** Before making a request to AWS License Manager User Subscriptions, validate your inputs on the client-side. This helps catch potential validation failures early and avoids unnecessary API calls.

2. **Follow the AWS License Manager User Subscriptions API documentation:** The API documentation provides detailed information about the validation rules for each operation. Make sure to review and adhere to these rules when constructing your requests.

3. **Handle exceptions gracefully:** When a `ValidationException` is thrown, handle it appropriately in your code. Log the error, display meaningful error messages to users, and take corrective actions as required.

4. **Maintain clear communication:** In situations where input validation failures occur, clearly communicate the issue and the required corrective actions to the relevant stakeholders. This helps streamline the development process and ensures that future requests meet the defined validation criteria.

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored the `ValidationException` class within the `com.amazonaws.services.licensemanagerusersubscriptions.model` package of AWS License Manager User Subscriptions. We learned that a `ValidationException` is raised when an input parameter fails to meet the validation rules set by the service.

We also examined code examples to understand how to use this exception effectively. Additionally, we discussed best practices for handling and preventing `ValidationExceptions` to ensure smooth integration with AWS License Manager User Subscriptions.

Now, armed with this knowledge, you are well-equipped to handle `ValidationExceptions` and utilize AWS License Manager User Subscriptions to its full potential.
