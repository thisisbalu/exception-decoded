## Introduction

Have you ever encountered the `IllegalSessionStateException` when working with the AWS Glue service? If you're a developer using AWS Glue, you might have come across this exception at some point. In this article, we will dive deep into what the `IllegalSessionStateException` is, its possible causes, and how to handle it effectively.

## Understanding the IllegalSessionStateException

The `IllegalSessionStateException` is an exception that arises within the AWS Glue service from the `com.amazonaws.services.glue.model` package. This exception is thrown when an operation is attempted on a stateful Amazon Glue client, but the client's session is in an illegal state.

---

## Possible causes

There are a few possible causes for the `IllegalSessionStateException`. By understanding these causes, you can better handle and prevent such exceptions in your AWS Glue workflows.

### 1. Expired or invalidated session

One common cause is when the AWS Glue client's session has expired or been invalidated. This can occur due to various reasons such as:

- The session duration configured in your AWS Glue job settings has expired.
- Parallel execution of multiple AWS Glue sessions, leading to conflicts and invalidation.
- The underlying AWS credentials used by the client have expired or been revoked.

When any of these situations occur, the AWS Glue client's session becomes illegal, and any subsequent operation will throw an `IllegalSessionStateException`.

### 2. Incompatible state transitions

Another possible cause is an attempt to perform an incompatible state transition on an AWS Glue session. The AWS Glue client manages its session states internally, and certain operations can only be executed in specific states.

For example, if you attempt to start a new crawler while the client's session is already running a crawler or performing any other conflicting operation, the `IllegalSessionStateException` will be raised.

## Handling and preventing

To effectively handle and prevent the `IllegalSessionStateException`, you need to take appropriate measures to ensure the AWS Glue client's session remains valid and operations are performed within compatible states.

### 1. Renew or refresh the session

If the `IllegalSessionStateException` occurs due to an expired or invalidated session, you can renew or refresh the session to ensure its validity. This can be done through the following steps:

```java
try {
    // Perform AWS Glue operations
} catch (IllegalSessionStateException e) {
    // Handle the exception by renewing or refreshing the session
    glueClient.renewSession();
    // Retry the operation after renewing the session
    // ...
}
```

By catching the `IllegalSessionStateException`, you can handle the exception by renewing or refreshing the session using the `renewSession` method provided by the AWS Glue client. Subsequently, you can retry the operation that led to the exception.

### 2. Optimize session management

To prevent conflicts and illegal session states caused by parallel execution of multiple AWS Glue sessions, it's vital to optimize session management. Ensure that:

- Multiple AWS Glue sessions do not interfere or overlap with each other.
- You properly release the resources associated with a session once the operation is completed. Failing to release resources might lead to session conflicts and hence, `IllegalSessionStateException`.
- If multiple clients are interacting with the AWS Glue service, implement synchronization mechanisms to avoid race conditions.

By addressing these points, you can minimize the chances of encountering the `IllegalSessionStateException`.

### 3. Verify and refresh AWS credentials

In case the `IllegalSessionStateException` is caused by expired or revoked AWS credentials associated with the client, it's crucial to verify and refresh those credentials. This can be done using the AWS SDK's credential provider:

```java
// Verify credentials
AWSCredentialsProvider awsCredentialsProvider = new DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain();
AwsClientBuilder.EndpointConfiguration endpointConfiguration = new AwsClientBuilder.EndpointConfiguration("glue.us-east-1.amazonaws.com", "us-east-1");
AWSGlueClientBuilder.builder()
        .withCredentials(awsCredentialsProvider)
        .withEndpointConfiguration(endpointConfiguration)
        .build();

// Refresh credentials
awsCredentialsProvider.refresh();
```

By verifying credentials using the `DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain`, you ensure their validity. Additionally, refreshing the credentials with `awsCredentialsProvider.refresh()` helps avoid `IllegalSessionStateException`.

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored the `IllegalSessionStateException` in AWS Glue and discussed its possible causes and how to handle the exception effectively. Remember to renew or refresh the session, optimize session management, and verify and refresh AWS credentials to prevent and handle this exception.
