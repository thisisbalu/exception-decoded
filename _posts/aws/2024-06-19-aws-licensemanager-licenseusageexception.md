**Are you facing LicenseUsageException while using AWS License Manager? Don't worry, we've got you covered!**

In this article, we will dive deep into understanding the LicenseUsageException of the `com.amazonaws.services.licensemanager.model` in AWS License Manager. We will discuss the causes of this exception, ways to handle it, and provide code examples to illustrate the solutions.

## What is LicenseUsageException?

`LicenseUsageException` is an exception class in the `com.amazonaws.services.licensemanager.model` package of AWS License Manager. This exception is thrown when there is an issue with license usage, preventing the successful completion of an operation.

## Causes of LicenseUsageException

There are various reasons why this exception may be thrown in AWS License Manager. Some common causes include:

1. **License Limit Reached**: This exception can occur when the usage limit for a specific license type has been reached. It often happens when the number of concurrently used licenses exceeds the maximum allowed limit.

2. **Invalid or Expired License**: If the license associated with an operation is either invalid or expired, the `LicenseUsageException` can be thrown. This typically happens when attempting to use a license that has been revoked or has passed its expiration date.

3. **Incompatible License**: When the license being used does not match the requirements or restrictions of the requested operation, the `LicenseUsageException` can be raised. This can occur when attempting to use a license for a different product or version than the one specified.

## Handling LicenseUsageException

When encountering a `LicenseUsageException`, you can handle it in your code to gracefully recover from the error. The following code snippet demonstrates how to catch and handle the exception in Java:

```java
try {
    // Perform the operation that may throw LicenseUsageException
} catch (LicenseUsageException e) {
    // Handle the exception
    System.out.println("LicenseUsageException: " + e.getMessage());
    // Additional error handling logic
}
```

By catching the exception, you can gracefully terminate the operation, display an error message, or perform any necessary cleanup tasks.

## Code Examples

Let's explore a few code examples to better understand how to handle `LicenseUsageException` in different scenarios.

1. **Example: Checking License Availability**

The following example demonstrates how to check if a license is available before using it:

```java
public boolean isLicenseAvailable(String licenseId) {
    try {
        // Get license information using the licenseId
        License license = licenseManager.getLicense(licenseId);
        // Check if license is available
        return license.getAvailability() > 0;
    } catch (LicenseUsageException e) {
        // Handle the exception (e.g., log, display error message)
        System.out.println("LicenseUsageException: " + e.getMessage());
        return false;
    }
}
```

2. **Example: Handling Expired License**

In this example, we handle the situation where a license has expired:

```java
public void performOperationWithLicense(String licenseId) throws LicenseUsageException {
    try {
        // Check if license is expired
        if (isLicenseExpired(licenseId)) {
            throw new LicenseUsageException("License has expired");
        } else {
            // Perform the operation
            // ...
        }
    } catch (LicenseUsageException e) {
        // Handle the exception (e.g., log, display error message)
        System.out.println("LicenseUsageException: " + e.getMessage());
        // Additional error handling logic
    }
}

private boolean isLicenseExpired(String licenseId) {
    // Check if license is expired
    // ...
    // Return true if expired, false otherwise
}
```

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored the `LicenseUsageException` in AWS License Manager, understanding its causes and ways to handle it in your code. We provided code examples to illustrate different scenarios where this exception can occur and shared best practices for handling it.

Now that you have a better understanding of how to handle `LicenseUsageException`, you can effectively troubleshoot and manage license-related issues in your AWS License Manager implementation.
