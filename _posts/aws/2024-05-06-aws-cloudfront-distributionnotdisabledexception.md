## Introduction

When working with AWS CloudFront, you may come across the DistributionNotDisabledException, an exception that occurs when trying to perform actions on disabled distributions. In this article, we will dive deep into this exception, understand its causes, and explore how to handle it effectively.

## Understanding DistributionNotDisabledException

The DistributionNotDisabledException is a specific exception belonging to the com.amazonaws.services.cloudfront.model package in AWS CloudFront. It is thrown when attempting to make changes or perform operations on a distribution that is currently disabled.

A distribution in AWS CloudFront represents a content delivery network (CDN) that helps efficiently deliver web content to users by caching it in edge locations worldwide. A disabled distribution means that it is not actively serving content at that moment, and thus certain operations are not permitted until the distribution is re-enabled.

## Causes of DistributionNotDisabledException

There are several scenarios in which the DistributionNotDisabledException may occur:

1. **Attempt to update a disabled distribution**: When you try to modify the configuration of a disabled distribution, such as updating cache behaviors or custom SSL certificates, the exception will be thrown. CloudFront requires the distribution to be active for such changes to take effect.

2. **Invalidation on a disabled distribution**: If you attempt to perform an invalidation on a disabled distribution, the DistributionNotDisabledException will be raised. Invalidations are used to remove or invalidate objects from the CloudFront cache.

## Handling DistributionNotDisabledException

To handle the DistributionNotDisabledException, consider the following approaches:

1. **Check distribution status**: Before attempting any actions that might trigger the exception, always check the status of the distribution. You can retrieve the distribution status using the `getDistribution` method provided by the `AmazonCloudFrontClient` class.

```java
try {
    GetDistributionRequest request = new GetDistributionRequest(distributionId);
    GetDistributionResult result = amazonCloudFrontClient.getDistribution(request);
    String distributionStatus = result.getDistribution().getStatus();
    if (distributionStatus.equals("Disabled")) {
        // Handle disabled distribution
    } else {
        // Distribution is active, perform actions
    }
} catch (DistributionNotDisabledException e) {
    // Handle the exception
}
```

2. **Reactivate distribution**: In cases where the distribution needs to be active for the desired operation, you can programmatically reactivate it before performing the action. This can be achieved using the `updateDistribution` method with an updated distribution configuration.

```java
try {
    GetDistributionRequest getRequest = new GetDistributionRequest(distributionId);
    GetDistributionResult getResult = amazonCloudFrontClient.getDistribution(getRequest);
    Distribution distribution = getResult.getDistribution();

    // Update distribution configuration
    distribution.setEnabled(true);

    UpdateDistributionRequest request = new UpdateDistributionRequest()
            .withId(distributionId)
            .withDistributionConfig(distribution.getDistributionConfig())
            .withIfMatch(distribution.getETag());

    UpdateDistributionResult result = amazonCloudFrontClient.updateDistribution(request);

    // Perform desired actions on the reactivated distribution
} catch (DistributionNotDisabledException e) {
    // Handle the exception
}
```

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored the DistributionNotDisabledException in AWS CloudFront, its causes, and strategies to effectively handle it. Always remember to check the distribution status before performing actions and, if necessary, reactivate the distribution programmatically. By implementing these best practices, you can ensure the smooth functioning of your AWS CloudFront distributions.
