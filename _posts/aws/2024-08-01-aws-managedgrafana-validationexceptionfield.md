## Introduction

Amazon Managed Grafana is a fully managed and secure data visualization service by AWS. It simplifies the process of creating insightful dashboards and analyzing metrics, logs, and traces from various data sources. In this article, we will take a detailed look at the `ValidationExceptionField` class in the `com.amazonaws.services.managedgrafana.model` package. We will explore its purpose, functionality, and usage with code examples to better understand how it fits into the overall Managed Grafana ecosystem.

## Understanding ValidationExceptionField

The `ValidationExceptionField` class is a helpful component of the Amazon Managed Grafana Java SDK. It represents the fields that caused a validation exception when executing an API operation. It contains two properties - `name` and `message`.

- `name` (String): The name of the field that failed validation.
- `message` (String): The error message associated with the validation failure.

By leveraging the `ValidationExceptionField` class, developers can easily identify the specific fields and corresponding error messages that failed validation during an API call.

## Code Examples

Let's dive into some code examples to gain a deeper understanding of how to work with the `ValidationExceptionField` class.

### Example 1: Retrieving Validation Exception Fields

To retrieve the validation exception fields, we need to catch and handle the `ValidationException` thrown by the Managed Grafana API call. Here's an example:

```java
try {
    // Managed Grafana API operation
} catch (com.amazonaws.services.managedgrafana.model.ValidationException e) {
    // Handling the validation exception
    java.util.List<ValidationExceptionField> fieldList = e.getFields();
    for (ValidationExceptionField field : fieldList) {
        System.out.println("Field: " + field.getName());
        System.out.println("Message: " + field.getMessage());
    }
}
```

In this example, we catch the `ValidationException` and retrieve its fields using the `getFields()` method. We then iterate over the fields and print their names and error messages.

### Example 2: Creating a Validation Exception Field

You can also manually create a `ValidationExceptionField` object to represent a specific field and its associated error message. Here's an example:

```java
ValidationExceptionField field = new ValidationExceptionField()
        .withName("fieldName")
        .withMessage("Field value must be a positive integer.");
```

In this example, we create a new `ValidationExceptionField` instance and set its `name` and `message` using the `withName()` and `withMessage()` methods, respectively.

By customizing the `name` and `message` properties of a `ValidationExceptionField`, you can generate more specific and informative error messages.

## Conclusion

The `ValidationExceptionField` class plays a vital role in the Amazon Managed Grafana Java SDK by providing information about fields that failed validation during an API operation. By utilizing this class, developers can easily identify and handle validation errors, resulting in more robust applications that leverage the features of Managed Grafana seamlessly.

In this article, we explored the purpose and usage of the `ValidationExceptionField` class, along with code examples to showcase its functionality. We hope this deep dive has provided you with a comprehensive understanding of this essential component in the Amazon Managed Grafana ecosystem.
