AWS CodeCommit is a fully managed source control service that makes it easy for teams to host secure and scalable Git repositories. However, when working with approval rules and templates, you may encounter various exceptions that can disrupt your workflow. One such exception is `InvalidApprovalRuleTemplateDescriptionException`. In this article, we will delve into the ins and outs of this exception, covering what it is, when it occurs, how to identify it, and how to resolve it efficiently.

## What is InvalidApprovalRuleTemplateDescriptionException?

The `InvalidApprovalRuleTemplateDescriptionException` is an error that arises within the AWS SDK for CodeCommit when an issue with the description of an approval rule template is detected during validation. AWS enforces specific constraints on the description field in order to maintain data integrity and ensure clarity for users interacting with approval rules.

When you try to create or update an approval rule template and the description does not meet these criteria, AWS throws an `InvalidApprovalRuleTemplateDescriptionException`. Understanding this exception is key to avoiding interruptions in your development processes.

## Common Causes of InvalidApprovalRuleTemplateDescriptionException

1. **Length Constraints**:
   - The description must be between 1 and 1000 characters long. If you try to submit a description that exceeds this limit or is empty, the exception will be raised.
   
2. **Invalid Characters**:
   - The description can only include certain characters; special characters or unsupported formatting might lead to the exception.

3. **Empty string or null values**:
   - Providing an empty description will also trigger this exception since a non-empty value is required.

## Example Scenario

Let's say you are attempting to create an approval rule template in AWS CodeCommit through the AWS SDK for Java. Inappropriately formatted descriptions may lead to an error as shown below.

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.AWSCodeCommit;
import com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.AWSCodeCommitClientBuilder;
import com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.model.CreateApprovalRuleTemplateRequest;
import com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.model.InvalidApprovalRuleTemplateDescriptionException;

public class CreateApprovalRuleTemplate {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AWSCodeCommit codeCommit = AWSCodeCommitClientBuilder.defaultClient();

        try {
            CreateApprovalRuleTemplateRequest request = new CreateApprovalRuleTemplateRequest()
                .withApprovalRuleTemplateName("MyApprovalRuleTemplate")
                .withApprovalRuleTemplateDescription("") // Invalid Description
                .withApprovalRuleTemplateContent("..."); // Example content

            codeCommit.createApprovalRuleTemplate(request);

        } catch (InvalidApprovalRuleTemplateDescriptionException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
            // Handle the exception, perhaps prompt for a valid description
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, trying to create an approval rule template with an empty description will trigger the `InvalidApprovalRuleTemplateDescriptionException`. The catch block provides an opportunity to inform the user of the requirement.

## How to Resolve InvalidApprovalRuleTemplateDescriptionException

To resolve the `InvalidApprovalRuleTemplateDescriptionException`, consider the following steps:

### 1. Ensure Valid Length

Make sure your description meets the character length requirements:

- Minimum: 1 character
- Maximum: 1000 characters

### 2. Character Validation

Restrict your inputs to ASCII characters or those specified in the AWS documentation. Avoid using unusual special characters.

### 3. Non-Empty Strings

Always provide a non-empty string as a description. Below is a corrected version of the previous code:

```java
public class CreateApprovalRuleTemplate {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AWSCodeCommit codeCommit = AWSCodeCommitClientBuilder.defaultClient();

        try {
            CreateApprovalRuleTemplateRequest request = new CreateApprovalRuleTemplateRequest()
                .withApprovalRuleTemplateName("MyApprovalRuleTemplate")
                .withApprovalRuleTemplateDescription("This is a valid description.") // Valid Description
                .withApprovalRuleTemplateContent("..."); // Example content

            codeCommit.createApprovalRuleTemplate(request);

        } catch (InvalidApprovalRuleTemplateDescriptionException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
            // Handle the exception appropriately
        }
    }
}
```

In this version, the provided description is valid, thus alleviating the possibility of encountering the `InvalidApprovalRuleTemplateDescriptionException`.

## Testing and Validation

Once changes are made to ensure that descriptions are valid, test your code thoroughly to confirm that it works as expected. Utilize unit tests to ensure that your implementation correctly handles various input scenarios, including edge cases such as maximum length entries or special characters.

```java
public class ApprovalTemplateValidationTest {

    @Test(expected = InvalidApprovalRuleTemplateDescriptionException.class)
    public void testEmptyDescription() {
        // Attempt to create an approval rule template with an empty description
        createApprovalRuleTemplate("");
    }

    @Test
    public void testValidDescription() {
        // Attempt to create an approval rule template with a valid description
        createApprovalRuleTemplate("This is a valid description.");
        // Assert successful creation
    }

    private void createApprovalRuleTemplate(String description) {
        // Your implementation here
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

The `InvalidApprovalRuleTemplateDescriptionException` can seem daunting at first, but with a clear understanding of the constraints placed on approval rule template descriptions, developers can swiftly navigate around this issue. By adhering to length requirements, validating character usage, and ensuring non-empty values, you can save time and maintain an efficient workflow in AWS CodeCommit.
