## Introduction

Are you encountering the dreaded [`ResourceNotFoundException`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams-webrtc-dg/latest/devguide/API_UpdateDataRetention.html#KinesisVideoStreamsWebrtc-UpdateDataRetention-ResourceNotFoundException) while working with AWS Kinesis Video WebRTC Storage? Don't worry, in this comprehensive guide, we will discuss everything you need to know about this exception and how to handle it effectively.

## Understanding the ResourceNotFoundException

The `ResourceNotFoundException` is a common error that occurs when attempting to access a resource that doesn't exist within the AWS Kinesis Video WebRTC Storage service. This exception is thrown when the requested resource, such as a stream, data retention period, or signaling channel, cannot be found.

The exception is typically caused by one of the following scenarios:

1. **Incorrect resource name**: Make sure the resource name, such as a stream name, is spelled correctly and matches an existing resource. It is essential to be case-sensitive.

2. **Resource not created**: AWS Kinesis Video WebRTC Storage requires you to explicitly create resources before using them. Check if the resource you are trying to access has been created.

3. **Resource deleted**: If a resource has been deleted, attempting to access it will result in a `ResourceNotFoundException`. Ensure that the resource you are trying to access has not been deleted.

## Handling ResourceNotFoundException

To effectively handle the `ResourceNotFoundException`, it is crucial to follow best practices and implement error handling mechanisms in your code. Here are some strategies you can use:

### 1. Verify Resource Existence

Before attempting to access a resource, double-check its existence. You can call appropriate API methods to retrieve and validate the resource's existence. For example, if you are working with streams, you can use the `DescribeStream` API to check if a stream exists before performing any operations on it.

Here's an example of how to check if a stream exists in Java:

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.kinesisvideo.GetMedia;
import com.amazonaws.services.kinesisvideo.KinesisVideoClient;
import com.amazonaws.services.kinesisvideo.model.ResourceNotFoundException;
import com.amazonaws.services.kinesisvideo.model.DescribeStreamRequest;
import com.amazonaws.services.kinesisvideo.model.DescribeStreamResult;

KinesisVideoClient client = new KinesisVideoClient();
DescribeStreamRequest describeStreamRequest = new DescribeStreamRequest()
    .withStreamName("my-stream");

try {
    DescribeStreamResult describeStreamResult = client.describeStream(describeStreamRequest);
    // Stream exists, proceed with the desired operations
} catch (ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
    // Handle the exception appropriately
}
```

### 2. Handle the Exception

When a `ResourceNotFoundException` is thrown, it is essential to handle it gracefully to provide a meaningful response to the user or take the necessary steps to mitigate the issue. Handle the exception in your code by implementing appropriate error handling routines, such as logging the error details or displaying a user-friendly message.

Here's an example of handling a `ResourceNotFoundException` in Python:

```python
import botocore.exceptions

client = boto3.client('kinesisvideo')
stream_name = 'my-stream'

try:
    response = client.describe_stream(StreamName=stream_name)
except botocore.exceptions.ResourceNotFoundException as e:
```

### 3. Implement Retry Logic

In some cases, a `ResourceNotFoundException` might occur due to temporary issues, such as propagation delay or eventual consistency. Implementing a retry mechanism can help mitigate these transient errors and increase the chances of successfully accessing the resource.

You can use various retry strategies such as exponential backoff or jittered exponential backoff, where you progressively wait for a longer time between retries. Additionally, you can add a maximum retry limit to prevent indefinitely retrying unsuccessful requests.

Here's an example of implementing a retry logic in Node.js using the AWS SDK:

```javascript
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const kinesisvideo = new AWS.KinesisVideo();

const streamName = 'my-stream';

function describeStreamWithRetry() {
  const describeStreamParams = {
    StreamName: streamName
  };

  const maxRetries = 3;
  let retries = 0;

  function describeStream() {
    return kinesisvideo.describeStream(describeStreamParams).promise()
      .catch((error) => {
        if (error.code === 'ResourceNotFoundException') {
          if (retries < maxRetries) {
            retries++;
            const delay = Math.pow(2, retries) * 1000;
            return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, delay)).then(describeStream);
          }
        }
        throw error;
      });
  }

  return describeStream();
}
```
