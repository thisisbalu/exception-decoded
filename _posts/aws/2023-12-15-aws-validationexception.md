## Introduction

AWS Location provides developers with a powerful set of tools to build location-based applications. One of the key classes in the AWS Location Java SDK is `com.amazonaws.services.location.model.ValidationException`, which is used for handling validation errors in API requests. In this article, we will take an in-depth look at the `ValidationException` class and explore its various use cases and code examples.

## What is a ValidationException?

A `ValidationException` is an error that occurs when input data fails to meet specified requirements. In the context of AWS Location, this typically occurs when making requests to the API, and the provided request parameters do not pass validations.

## Understanding the ValidationException Class

The `com.amazonaws.services.location.model.ValidationException` class is part of the AWS Location Java SDK and extends the `com.amazonaws.AmazonServiceException` class. This means that it inherits some common properties and methods for handling exceptions in AWS services.

### Key Features of ValidationException

1. **Error Codes**: The `ValidationException` class provides detailed information about the error through an error code, which can be accessed using the `getErrorCode()` method. This helps developers to precisely identify the cause of the validation error.

2. **Error Messages**: In addition to the error code, `ValidationException` also provides an error message using the `getErrorMessage()` method. This message contains human-readable information about the validation error, making it easier to understand the issue at hand.

3. **API Requests**: When making API requests, the `ValidationException` can be thrown if the provided input data fails to satisfy the requirements. By catching this exception, developers can handle the error gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to users.

### Code Examples

Let's explore some code examples to better understand how to handle the `ValidationException` class in AWS Location.

**1. Basic Exception Handling**

```java
try {
    // Make an API request
} catch(ValidationException e) {
    System.err.println("Validation Error: " + e.getErrorMessage());
    System.err.println("Error Code: " + e.getErrorCode());
}
```

In this example, we catch the `ValidationException` and print the error message and error code associated with the exception. This helps us understand the cause of the validation error and take appropriate action.

**2. Handling Multiple Validation Errors**

```java
try {
    // Make an API request
} catch(ValidationException e) {
    e.getValidationErrors().forEach(error ->
        System.err.println("Field: " + error.getFieldName() +
            ", Error Message: " + error.getMessage()));
}
```

Here, we catch the `ValidationException` and iterate over each validation error using the `getValidationErrors()` method. This allows us to handle multiple validation errors and provide detailed information about each field that failed validation.

## Conclusion

The `com.amazonaws.services.location.model.ValidationException` class is a crucial part of the AWS Location Java SDK, providing developers with the means to handle validation errors while making API requests. By understanding the various features of this class and leveraging its code examples, developers can ensure robust error handling in their location-based applications.

This article has provided an in-depth overview of the `ValidationException` class and demonstrated how to effectively handle it in your code. We hope this guide has been helpful in gaining a better understanding of this essential component of the AWS Location API.

To learn more about the `ValidationException` class and other features of the AWS Location Java SDK, refer to the official AWS documentation:
