Are you a developer who uses AWS CodeStar for project collaboration and management? If so, you're probably aware of the difficulties that arise when team members are unable to access or locate specific projects within CodeStar. Fortunately, AWS CodeStar offers an exception, `TeamMemberNotFoundException`, which can help identify and resolve such issues effectively.

In this article, we'll explore the intricacies of `TeamMemberNotFoundException` and provide you with step-by-step instructions to handle this exception seamlessly. Buckle up and let's dive into the world of AWS CodeStar!

## Understanding `TeamMemberNotFoundException`
`TeamMemberNotFoundException` is an exception that is thrown when a team member attempts to access or perform an operation on a project within AWS CodeStar but fails because the member is not present or has insufficient permissions. This specific exception is part of the `com.amazonaws.services.codestar.model` package.

## Avoiding `TeamMemberNotFoundException`
To avoid encountering `TeamMemberNotFoundException` in your AWS CodeStar activities, it is crucial to adhere to certain best practices when working with team members. Here are some key strategies:

### 1. Ensure Team Membership
Before granting access or assigning roles within AWS CodeStar, make sure that all team members are registered and have been added to the project. This can be achieved by following these steps:

```java
AWSCodeStar codeStar = AWSCodeStarClientBuilder.defaultClient();

CreateUserProfileRequest userProfileRequest = new CreateUserProfileRequest()
    .withUserArn("<USER_ARN>")
    .withDisplayName("<DISPLAY_NAME>")
    .withEmailAddress("<EMAIL_ADDRESS>");

codeStar.createUserProfile(userProfileRequest);
```

### 2. Provide Proper Permissions
To prevent `TeamMemberNotFoundException`, ensure that each team member has the appropriate permissions for the project. The following example demonstrates how you can assign a role to a user:

```java
codeStar.associateTeamMember(new AssociateTeamMemberRequest()
    .withProjectId("<PROJECT_ID>")
    .withClientRequestToken("<CLIENT_REQUEST_TOKEN>")
    .withUserArn("<USER_ARN>")
    .withProjectRole("Contributor"));
```

### 3. Confirm Correct Project Details
The `TeamMemberNotFoundException` can also occur when a team member attempts to access a project with incorrect or outdated details. To avoid this, double-check that the project ID provided matches the project you want to access:

```java
codeStar.describeProject(new DescribeProjectRequest()
    .withId("<PROJECT_ID>"));
```

## Handling `TeamMemberNotFoundException`
Despite your best efforts, it's possible that you may still encounter `TeamMemberNotFoundException`. Worry not! We've got you covered on how to gracefully handle this exception:

### Get Team Member Details
To better understand the cause of the exception, obtain the details of the missing team member. This will help in troubleshooting and identifying any anomalies:

```java
codeStar.describeUserProfile(new DescribeUserProfileRequest()
    .withUserArn("<USER_ARN>"));
```

### Prompt User to Retry or Seek Assistance
Provide an informative error message to the team member who encountered the `TeamMemberNotFoundException`. Suggest possible solutions, such as retrying the operation, reaching out to a team lead or project manager, or seeking assistance from AWS support if necessary:

```java
try {
    // Code that may throw TeamMemberNotFoundException
} catch (TeamMemberNotFoundException ex) {
    System.err.println("Oops! It seems you are not a registered team member or don't have the required permissions for this project. Please reach out to your project manager for assistance.");
}
```

### Log the Exception
Logging the exception details can be beneficial, as it helps track and analyze recurring instances of `TeamMemberNotFoundException`. Take advantage of logging frameworks like AWS CloudWatch to centralize and manage your logs effectively.

```java
try {
    // Code that may throw TeamMemberNotFoundException
} catch (TeamMemberNotFoundException ex) {
    LOGGER.error("TeamMemberNotFoundException occurred. Error details - ", ex);
}
```

### Continuous Monitoring and Alerting
In order to proactively detect and identify instances of `TeamMemberNotFoundException`, set up monitoring and alerting mechanisms. This can be achieved by leveraging AWS CloudWatch or a similar service to monitor exceptional events within your AWS CodeStar environment.

## Conclusion
By diligently following the strategies outlined in this article, you can minimize the chances of encountering `TeamMemberNotFoundException` in your AWS CodeStar projects. Remember to ensure team membership, provide proper permissions, and consistently verify project details when working with team members.
