## Introduction

AWS CodeDeploy is a service that automates the deployment of applications to instances, making it easier to deploy updates across multiple environments. It provides a simple and consistent way to deploy applications on EC2 instances or on-premises servers.

In this article, we will discuss the `InvalidDeployedStateFilterException` of the `com.amazonaws.services.codedeploy.model` in AWS CodeDeploy. We will explore what this exception means, its causes, and how to handle it effectively.

## What is the InvalidDeployedStateFilterException?

The `InvalidDeployedStateFilterException` is an exception that can be thrown when using AWS CodeDeploy APIs, specifically when filtering deployments by the deployed state. The exception typically occurs when an invalid deployed state is provided as a filter parameter.

## Causes of the InvalidDeployedStateFilterException

The `InvalidDeployedStateFilterException` can be caused by different factors. Here are a few possible scenarios that may trigger this exception:

1. **Invalid Filter Value**: The exception can be thrown when an unsupported or unrecognized deployed state is provided as a filter value. CodeDeploy supports various deployed states, such as `InProgress`, `Succeeded`, `Failed`, `Stopped`, etc. If an invalid state is used, the exception will be raised.

2. **Incorrect Filter Configuration**: Another cause of this exception is an incorrect or invalid filter configuration. CodeDeploy provides functionality to filter deployments based on various criteria. If the filter configuration is misconfigured or contains invalid parameters, the exception may occur.

## Handling the InvalidDeployedStateFilterException

When dealing with the `InvalidDeployedStateFilterException`, it is essential to handle it gracefully to avoid disruption to your application deployment process. Here are some ways to handle this exception effectively:

### 1. Validate the Deployed State Filter Value

Before making any API calls that include a deployed state filter, ensure that the state value is valid. Refer to the [AWS CodeDeploy documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_ListDeployments.html) to determine the supported deployed states.

```java
try {
    // Filter deployments by deployed state
    ListDeploymentResponse response = codedeploy.listDeployments(new ListDeploymentsRequest()
        .withDeployedState("InProgress")
    );
} catch (InvalidDeployedStateFilterException e) {
    // Handle the exception gracefully
    System.out.println("Invalid deployed state filter value.");
}
```

### 2. Check the Filter Configuration

If the deployed state filter is applied correctly but still triggers the `InvalidDeployedStateFilterException`, check the filter configuration for any mistakes. Verify that the filter parameters are correctly set and correspond to the expected format.

```java
try {
    // Filter deployments by application name and deployed state
    ListDeploymentResponse response = codedeploy.listDeployments(new ListDeploymentsRequest()
        .withApplicationName("my-application")
        .withDeployedState("Succeeded")
    );
} catch (InvalidDeployedStateFilterException e) {
    // Handle the exception gracefully
    System.out.println("Invalid deployed state filter configuration.");
}
```

### 3. Provide Meaningful Error Messages

When handling the `InvalidDeployedStateFilterException`, it is important to provide clear and meaningful error messages to help troubleshoot the issue. You can log the relevant information or display user-friendly error messages to indicate the cause of the exception.

```java
try {
    // Filter deployments by deployed state
    ListDeploymentResponse response = codedeploy.listDeployments(new ListDeploymentsRequest()
        .withDeployedState("Pending")
    );
} catch (InvalidDeployedStateFilterException e) {
    // Handle the exception gracefully
    System.out.println("Invalid deployed state filter value: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

## Conclusion

The `InvalidDeployedStateFilterException` in AWS CodeDeploy occurs when there is an error in the filter configuration or an invalid deployed state value is provided. In this article, we discussed the possible causes of this exception and how to handle it effectively.

By validating the deployed state filter value, checking the filter configuration, and providing meaningful error messages, you can troubleshoot and resolve this exception more efficiently.

AWS CodeDeploy provides robust deployment capabilities, and understanding and handling exceptions like `InvalidDeployedStateFilterException` is crucial for a smooth and error-free deployment process.
