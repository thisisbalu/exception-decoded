## Introduction
Welcome to our technical blog! Today, we'll explore the InvalidDeployedStateFilterException in the **com.amazonaws.services.codedeploy.model** package of AWS CodeDeploy. This exception can be encountered when filtering deployments based on their deployed state, and understanding it is crucial for smooth development and deployment processes. In this article, we'll dive deep into the InvalidDeployedStateFilterException, cover its causes, discuss scenarios where it may occur, and provide code examples along the way.

## What is InvalidDeployedStateFilterException?
`InvalidDeployedStateFilterException` is a specific exception class in the **com.amazonaws.services.codedeploy.model** package of AWS CodeDeploy. It is thrown when attempting to filter deployments based on their deployed state, but an invalid state filter option is specified. This exception signals that the deployment could not be successfully filtered due to the incorrect or unsupported state filter specified.

## Causes of InvalidDeployedStateFilterException
The most common cause of this exception is providing an unsupported value as the state filter for your deployment. The allowed state filter values are **'Created'**, **'Queued'**, **'InProgress'**, **'Succeeded'**, **'Failed'**, or **'Stopped'**. However, providing any other value will lead to an `InvalidDeployedStateFilterException` being thrown.

Another potential cause is a typographical error or incorrect parameter value associated with state filters. Ensure that the filter values are passed correctly and do not contain any leading or trailing spaces.

## Scenarios where InvalidDeployedStateFilterException may occur
1. **Listing deployments:** When retrieving a list of deployments from AWS CodeDeploy using the `ListDeployments` API, providing an invalid state filter in the request can result in an `InvalidDeployedStateFilterException`. For example, attempting to filter deployments by state '**Pending**' would trigger this exception.

2. **Retrieving deployment details:** Similarly, fetching specific details of a deployment using the `BatchGetDeployments` or `GetDeployment` API calls requires a valid deployed state filter. If an incorrect state filter is used, an `InvalidDeployedStateFilterException` will be thrown.

## Handling the InvalidDeployedStateFilterException
When encountering the `InvalidDeployedStateFilterException`, it is crucial to review and modify the state filter parameter being passed. Ensure that the state filter value falls within the allowed range and is correctly spelled. For example, use '**Succeeded**' instead of '**Success**'.

Additionally, perform thorough input validation before making any API calls to avoid passing erroneous filter values. By validating the allowed filter values beforehand, you can catch potential issues early on and prevent the exception from being thrown.

## Code Examples
Here are a few code examples that demonstrate the usage of state filters in different scenarios:

1. **Listing deployments with a valid state filter:**

```java
com.amazonaws.services.codedeploy.AmazonCodeDeploy client = new com.amazonaws.services.codedeploy.AmazonCodeDeployClient();
com.amazonaws.services.codedeploy.model.ListDeploymentsRequest request = new com.amazonaws.services.codedeploy.model.ListDeploymentsRequest();

// Set a valid state filter
request.setDeployedStateFilter(new com.amazonaws.services.codedeploy.model.DeployedStateFilter().withIncludeOnlyStatuses("Succeeded", "InProgress"));

com.amazonaws.services.codedeploy.model.ListDeploymentsResult result = client.listDeployments(request);
// Process the result
```

2. **Incorrect state filter triggering the exception:**

```java
com.amazonaws.services.codedeploy.AmazonCodeDeploy client = new com.amazonaws.services.codedeploy.AmazonCodeDeployClient();
com.amazonaws.services.codedeploy.model.ListDeploymentsRequest request = new com.amazonaws.services.codedeploy.model.ListDeploymentsRequest();

// Set an invalid state filter
request.setDeployedStateFilter(new com.amazonaws.services.codedeploy.model.DeployedStateFilter().withIncludeOnlyStatuses("Pending"));

try {
    com.amazonaws.services.codedeploy.model.ListDeploymentsResult result = client.listDeployments(request);
    // Process the result
} catch (com.amazonaws.services.codedeploy.model.InvalidDeployedStateFilterException ex) {
    // Handle the exception and provide meaningful feedback
}
```

## Conclusion
In this article, we explored the InvalidDeployedStateFilterException in AWS CodeDeploy. Understanding this exception is crucial for effective filtering of deployments based on their state. We discussed its causes and scenarios where it may occur, and provided code examples to illustrate its usage. Remember to always validate input parameters and ensure correct state filter values to avoid encountering this exception.
