## Introduction

Are you using Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) for managing your database infrastructure on the cloud? If so, you might have come across the NetworkTypeNotSupportedException at some point. In this article, we will explore the NetworkTypeNotSupportedException in detail, understand its causes, and learn how to handle it effectively.

## Understanding NetworkTypeNotSupportedException

The `NetworkTypeNotSupportedException` is an exception class within the `com.amazonaws.services.rds.model` package in the AWS SDK for Java. It is thrown when you attempt to create or modify an Amazon RDS resource with an unsupported network type.

## Causes of NetworkTypeNotSupportedException

The main cause of this exception is attempting to use a network type that is not supported by Amazon RDS. Amazon RDS supports various network types, including Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and Amazon EC2-Classic. However, there are certain limitations and restrictions with each network type that you need to be aware of.

For example, if you are using a VPC, you might encounter the `NetworkTypeNotSupportedException` if you try to create or modify an Amazon RDS resource with a network type that is not compatible with VPC. Similarly, if you are using Amazon EC2-Classic, you might face this exception for network types that are not supported in that environment.

## Handling NetworkTypeNotSupportedException

To handle the `NetworkTypeNotSupportedException`, you need to ensure that you are using a valid and supported network type for your Amazon RDS resource.

Here are some steps you can take to handle this exception effectively:

1. Review the [Amazon RDS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) to understand the supported network types for your specific use case.
2. Double-check if you have selected the correct network type when creating or modifying your Amazon RDS resource.
3. If you are using VPC, ensure that the network type you are attempting to use is compatible with VPC.
4. If you are using Amazon EC2-Classic, verify if the network type you are trying to use is supported in that environment.
5. Validate your VPC or EC2-Classic configuration if necessary.

By following these steps, you can avoid encountering the `NetworkTypeNotSupportedException` and ensure smooth operations with your Amazon RDS resources.

## Code Examples

Let's look at some code examples to understand how to handle the `NetworkTypeNotSupportedException` using the AWS SDK for Java.

1. Creating an Amazon RDS resource with VPC:

```java
AmazonRDS rds = AmazonRDSClientBuilder.defaultClient();

CreateDBInstanceRequest request = new CreateDBInstanceRequest()
    .withDBInstanceIdentifier("mydbinstance")
    .withEngine("mysql")
    .withDBInstanceClass("db.t2.micro")
    .withVpcSecurityGroupIds("vpc-security-group-id")
    .withPort(3306)
    .withMasterUsername("admin")
    .withMasterUserPassword("password")
    .withAllocatedStorage(20);

try {
    CreateDBInstanceResult result = rds.createDBInstance(request);
    System.out.println("Database instance created successfully!");
} catch (NetworkTypeNotSupportedException e) {
    System.err.println("Invalid network type provided: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

In this example, we are creating an Amazon RDS resource with a VPC, specifying all the necessary parameters. If the network type provided is not valid for VPC, the `NetworkTypeNotSupportedException` will be caught and an error message will be displayed.

2. Modifying an existing Amazon RDS resource:

```java
AmazonRDS rds = AmazonRDSClientBuilder.defaultClient();

ModifyDBInstanceRequest request = new ModifyDBInstanceRequest()
    .withDBInstanceIdentifier("mydbinstance")
    .withNewDBInstanceIdentifier("mydbinstance-new")
    .withApplyImmediately(true)
    .withVpcSecurityGroupIds("vpc-security-group-id");

try {
    ModifyDBInstanceResult result = rds.modifyDBInstance(request);
    System.out.println("Database instance modified successfully!");
} catch (NetworkTypeNotSupportedException e) {
    System.err.println("Invalid network type provided: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

In this example, we are modifying an existing Amazon RDS resource, including changing the VPC security group. If the network type provided is not supported, the `NetworkTypeNotSupportedException` will be caught and an error message will be displayed.

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored the `NetworkTypeNotSupportedException` in the AWS RDS SDK for Java. We discussed its causes, ways to handle it effectively, and provided code examples to showcase its usage.

By understanding and handling this exception correctly, you can ensure smooth operations with your Amazon RDS resources and avoid disruptions in your database management workflows.
