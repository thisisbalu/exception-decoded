Introduction:

Welcome to another insightful blog post on AWS CodePipeline! In this article, we will dive deep into the OutputVariablesSizeExceededException, an exceptional situation you might encounter while working with AWS CodePipeline. We will explore what it is, why it occurs, and how you can mitigate or resolve it. So grab a cup of coffee and let's get started!

## Content:

### What is OutputVariablesSizeExceededException?

The OutputVariablesSizeExceededException is an exception thrown by the `com.amazonaws.services.codepipeline.model` class in AWS CodePipeline. It indicates that the size of output variables exceeds the maximum allowed limit. CodePipeline allows a maximum size limit for output variables to prevent performance degradation and ensure smooth pipeline execution.

When this exception occurs, it usually means that the pipeline has generated or processed output variables that surpass the specified limit. These output variables might contain important information or artifacts needed for downstream actions or deployments.

### Understanding the root cause:

Output variables are crucial for passing information between actions within a pipeline. They are used to store and share data, such as artifacts, environment variables, or metadata. However, storing large amounts of data within output variables can lead to performance issues and cause delays in pipeline execution.

CodePipeline imposes a limit on the size of output variables to maintain efficient pipeline operations. By default, the maximum size limit for output variables is 256 KB. When the limit is exceeded, the OutputVariablesSizeExceededException is thrown, indicating the need to optimize or reduce the data stored in the output variables.

### Resolving the OutputVariablesSizeExceededException:

To tackle the OutputVariablesSizeExceededException, you have a few options:

1. Identify and reduce unnecessary data: Review your pipeline configuration and actions to ensure that only necessary data is stored in output variables. Avoid including large files or excessive logs that are not required for downstream actions.

2. Utilize compression techniques: If the size of your output variables is mostly due to artifacts or text-based data, consider compressing the content before storing it in the variable. AWS provides various compression libraries and APIs that you can integrate into your pipeline to effectively reduce the size of the output variables.

3. Leverage artifact stores: Instead of storing large artifacts or files in the output variables directly, consider utilizing dedicated artifact stores, such as Amazon S3 or AWS Artifact. You can store the artifact in a separate location and reference it with a lightweight identifier within the output variable.

4. Divide and conquer: If you have a large amount of data that needs to be passed between actions, consider breaking it down into smaller chunks and using multiple output variables. This approach helps distribute the data across multiple variables, ensuring that individual limits are not exceeded.

By employing these practices, you can optimize your CodePipeline configuration, reduce the size of output variables, and avoid the OutputVariablesSizeExceededException.

### Conclusion:

In this article, we explored the OutputVariablesSizeExceededException commonly encountered in AWS CodePipeline. We learned about its nature, why it occurs, and ways to tackle it effectively. Optimizing the size of output variables not only helps maintain the performance and efficiency of your pipelines but also prevents potential execution delays.

By analyzing your pipeline configuration, compressing data, using dedicated artifact stores, and dividing larger data into smaller chunks, you can mitigate the risks associated with the OutputVariablesSizeExceededException.

Remember, it is essential to strike a balance between passing necessary data through output variables and keeping them within the recommended size limits to ensure a smooth and uninterrupted CodePipeline experience.
