## Introduction
Approval stages in AWS CodePipeline allow manual intervention in the pipeline workflow. They enable team members to approve or reject a particular stage. However, in certain cases, you may encounter an `ApprovalAlreadyCompletedException` when trying to submit an already approved or rejected stage for approval again. In this article, we will explore this exception in detail, understand its causes, and discover ways to handle it effectively.

## What is the ApprovalAlreadyCompletedException?
The `ApprovalAlreadyCompletedException` is a runtime exception that occurs when attempting to submit an approval request for a stage that has already been approved or rejected in AWS CodePipeline. This exception is a part of the `com.amazonaws.services.codepipeline.model` package used in AWS CodePipeline APIs.

## Causes of the Exception
The exception is thrown when AWS CodePipeline API receives an approval request for a stage that is already marked as approved or rejected. This usually happens due to one of the following reasons:

1. **Concurrency Issues**: In a multi-user environment, multiple users may attempt to submit approval requests simultaneously. If one user completes the approval processing before the other user's request arrives, the subsequent request can result in this exception.

2. **Misconfiguration in Pipeline**: It is possible that the pipeline has been configured incorrectly, causing it to send multiple approval requests for the same stage. This misconfiguration can lead to the exception when CodePipeline receives repeated approval requests.

## Handling the ApprovalAlreadyCompletedException
When encountering the `ApprovalAlreadyCompletedException`, you can handle it gracefully by considering the following approaches:

### 1. Implement Retrying Mechanism
Since the exception is often a result of concurrency issues, implementing a retrying mechanism can help overcome such scenarios. By retrying the approval request after a short delay, you can avoid the exception caused by conflicting operations. Here's an example of how you can implement a basic retry mechanism using the AWS SDK for Java:

```java
int maxRetries = 3;
int retryCount = 0;
boolean retry = true;

while (retry && retryCount < maxRetries) {
    try {
        // Submit the approval request
        // CodePipelineClient.submitApprovalResult(request);
        
        retry = false;
    } catch (ApprovalAlreadyCompletedException e) {
        retryCount++;
        Thread.sleep(1000); // Delay before retrying
    }
}
```

In the code snippet above, the approval request is submitted inside a loop. If the exception occurs, the code will retry the request up to a maximum number of times defined by `maxRetries`. After a successful submission or reaching the maximum retries, the loop breaks.

### 2. Validate Pipeline Configuration
To avoid misconfiguration in the pipeline that can lead to repeated approval requests, review the pipeline settings and ensure that the stages are configured correctly. Check for any duplicates in the pipeline structure and remove any unnecessary or duplicate steps. Additionally, ensure that each stage is programmed to trigger the approval request only once.

### 3. Implement Defensive Programming
Defensive programming practices can help mitigate the occurrence of the `ApprovalAlreadyCompletedException`. Ensure that any code or scripts triggering approval requests are idempotent, meaning they can be run multiple times without causing any unintended side effects. By designing your code with idempotence in mind, you can reduce the likelihood of resubmitting approval requests unnecessarily.

## Conclusion
The `ApprovalAlreadyCompletedException` in AWS CodePipeline is a runtime exception that occurs when attempting to submit an already approved or rejected stage for approval again. It is commonly caused by concurrency issues and misconfigurations in the pipeline structure. By implementing a retrying mechanism, validating pipeline configuration, and following defensive programming techniques, you can effectively handle this exception and ensure smoother workflows in your CodePipeline.

**Note:** Handling exceptions in your application is crucial, but it's equally important to identify the root cause behind such exceptions and fix them at the source. Consider analyzing your pipeline configuration and workflow to eliminate potential causes of the `ApprovalAlreadyCompletedException`.
