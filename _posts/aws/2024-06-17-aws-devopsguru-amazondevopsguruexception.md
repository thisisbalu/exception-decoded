## Common Scenarios and Error Codes

    if ("ThrottlingException".equals(ex.getErrorCode())) {
        // Implement retry logic here
    } else {
        // Handle other exceptions
    }
}
```

The `AccessDeniedException` is thrown when the calling IAM user or role doesn't have the necessary permissions to perform the requested operation on the AWS DevOps Guru service.

    // Code that interacts with the AWS DevOps Guru service
} catch (AmazonDevOpsGuruException ex) {
    if ("AccessDeniedException".equals(ex.getErrorCode())) {
        // Handle access denied exception
    } else {
        // Handle other exceptions
    }
