## Introduction
AWS CloudFront is a robust content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers your static and dynamic web content to your users with low latency and high data transfer speeds. To ensure smooth content delivery, CloudFront offers various features and functionality to optimize your distribution settings. In this article, we will explore DistributionNotDisabledException, an exception model in the `com.amazonaws.services.cloudfront.model` package that signifies a crucial aspect of CloudFront distribution management.

## DistributionNotDisabledException
DistributionNotDisabledException is a specialized exception thrown when you attempt to perform certain actions on a CloudFront distribution that is not currently disabled. This exception is thrown within the `com.amazonaws.services.cloudfront.model` package, a core component of CloudFront's Java SDK. It is important to understand this exception in order to handle it appropriately when building cloud-native applications that leverage CloudFront's extensive capabilities.

## Use Cases
Understanding the scenarios where DistributionNotDisabledException may occur is essential for efficient distribution management. The exception is typically thrown when you attempt to perform specific operations on a CloudFront distribution that is not in a disabled state. Here are some scenarios where this exception can be encountered:

1. **Updating Distribution Settings** - When updating various settings such as cache behavior, origin configuration, or SSL/TLS certificates for a distribution, the distribution needs to be in a disabled state. If it is not, a `DistributionNotDisabledException` will be thrown.

2. **Deleting a Distribution** - Prior to deleting a CloudFront distribution, it is critical to disable it first. If the distribution is not in a disabled state during the deletion process, `DistributionNotDisabledException` may be thrown.

## Handling DistributionNotDisabledException
To handle a `DistributionNotDisabledException`, you should first verify the state of the distribution before performing any necessary operations. The `com.amazonaws.services.cloudfront.AmazonCloudFrontClient` class provides various methods to interact with distributions, including the ability to retrieve information about the current state of a distribution.

Here is an example Java code snippet that shows how to handle `DistributionNotDisabledException` when updating a distribution's settings:

```java
public void updateDistributionSettings(String distributionId, DistributionConfig distributionConfig) {
    AmazonCloudFrontClient cloudFrontClient = new AmazonCloudFrontClient();

    // Check if distribution is currently enabled
    if (isDistributionEnabled(distributionId)) {
        throw new DistributionNotDisabledException("Distribution must be disabled before updating its settings.");
    }

    UpdateDistributionRequest request = new UpdateDistributionRequest()
            .withDistributionConfig(distributionConfig)
            .withId(distributionId)
            .withIfMatch(getLatestETag(distributionId));
    cloudFrontClient.updateDistribution(request);
}

private boolean isDistributionEnabled(String distributionId) {
    AmazonCloudFrontClient cloudFrontClient = new AmazonCloudFrontClient();
    GetDistributionRequest request = new GetDistributionRequest().withId(distributionId);
    GetDistributionResult result = cloudFrontClient.getDistribution(request);

    return result.getDistribution().getDistributionConfig().isEnabled();
}
```

In the above code, the `isDistributionEnabled()` method retrieves the current state of the distribution by calling the `getDistribution()` method and checking the value of the `isEnabled()` property. If the distribution is enabled, a `DistributionNotDisabledException` is thrown, preventing the update operation from proceeding.

## Conclusion
Understanding the `DistributionNotDisabledException` model and its various use cases is crucial for efficient distribution management within AWS CloudFront. By considering this exception and handling it appropriately, you can ensure smoother operations when updating distribution settings or deleting distributions. Remember to always check the state of the distribution before performing any related actions, and be mindful of the exceptions thrown to create robust and reliable cloud-native applications.
