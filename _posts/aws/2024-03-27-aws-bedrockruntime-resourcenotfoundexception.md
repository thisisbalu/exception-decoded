Are you an AWS Bedrock Runtime user? Then, you might have encountered the ResourceNotFoundException at some point in your development journey. Don't worry! In this article, we will dive deep into this exception and explore how to handle it effectively. So, let's get started!

## What is AWS Bedrock Runtime?

Before we explore the ResourceNotFoundException, let's have a brief overview of AWS Bedrock Runtime. Bedrock Runtime is a managed service provided by AWS, designed to simplify the deployment and operation of Ethereum-based blockchain networks. With Bedrock Runtime, you can easily set up, scale, and manage your Ethereum network infrastructure.

## Understanding the ResourceNotFoundException

The ResourceNotFoundException is a common exception thrown by the `com.amazonaws.services.bedrockruntime.model` package within the AWS Bedrock Runtime. This exception is specifically thrown when a requested resource cannot be found or does not exist within the Bedrock Runtime environment.

### Causes of ResourceNotFoundException

There are a few different scenarios that can trigger a ResourceNotFoundException in Bedrock Runtime:

1. **Invalid ARN**: When you provide an invalid Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a particular resource, the exception will be thrown. Ensure that the ARN is correctly formatted and references an existing resource within the Bedrock Runtime environment.

```java
try {
    // Invalid ARN example
    String invalidArn = "arn:aws:bedrock:notfound";
    DescribeResourceRequest request = new DescribeResourceRequest().withResourceArn(invalidArn);
    DescribeResourceResult result = bedrockClient.describeResource(request);
} catch (ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
    // Handle the exception
    System.out.println("The requested resource does not exist!");
}
```

2. **Deleted Resource**: If you had previously created a resource in Bedrock Runtime and later deleted it, any attempt to access the deleted resource will result in a ResourceNotFoundException. Ensure that you are referencing active and existing resources.

```java
try {
    // Deleted resource example
    String deletedResourceArn = "arn:aws:bedrock:us-west-2:123456789:resource/123";
    DescribeResourceRequest request = new DescribeResourceRequest().withResourceArn(deletedResourceArn);
    DescribeResourceResult result = bedrockClient.describeResource(request);
} catch (ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
    // Handle the exception
    System.out.println("The requested resource has been deleted!");
}
```

### Handling the ResourceNotFoundException

Now that we understand what causes the ResourceNotFoundException, it's crucial to know how to handle it effectively in our applications. Here are a few best practices:

1. **Catch the Exception**: Always catch the ResourceNotFoundException and handle it gracefully. This will prevent unwanted application crashes and provide more meaningful error messages to users.

2. **Provide Clear Feedback**: When catching the ResourceNotFoundException, make sure to provide clear and informative feedback to end-users. Explain that the requested resource could not be found and guide them on how to proceed.

3. **Verify Resource Existence**: Before making any API calls or performing actions related to a specific resource, verify its existence using the appropriate API methods. This ensures that you won't encounter a ResourceNotFoundException unexpectedly.

### Additional Resources
