In the world of cloud computing and infrastructure management, AWS Simple Systems Management (SSM) is a powerful service designed to simplify operations for AWS environments. However, as you begin to integrate various resources and services, you may encounter exceptions that help maintain the integrity of your operations. One such exception is the `ResourceDataSyncCountExceededException`, which can impact your ability to synchronize data across your resources. In this article, we’ll delve into what this exception is, how and when it occurs, and practical examples to help you handle it effectively.

## What is ResourceDataSyncCountExceededException?

`ResourceDataSyncCountExceededException` is an exception thrown by the AWS SDK for Java when the number of Resource Data Sync (RDS) configurations exceeds the allowable limit for your AWS account. Resource Data Sync allows you to synchronize your Systems Manager (SSM) Inventory data across multiple AWS Regions and accounts, helping you maintain a consistent view of your resources and their configurations.

AWS enforces limits on various resources to ensure account stability and performance. For RDS, the specific limit is 100 sync configurations per account. When you attempt to create or update a sync configuration that would exceed this limit, the `ResourceDataSyncCountExceededException` is triggered.

### Common Error Message

When this exception occurs, you may see an error message similar to:

```
ResourceDataSyncCountExceededException: The maximum number of Resource Data Sync configurations has been reached (100).
```

## When Does This Exception Occur?

The `ResourceDataSyncCountExceededException` occurs in the following scenarios:

1. **Creating a New Sync Configuration**: Attempting to create a new sync configuration when your account already has 100 active configurations.

2. **Updating Existing Sync Configuration**: If you're trying to update a sync configuration and this action inadvertently causes the total number of configurations to exceed 100.

3. **Deleting Sync Configurations**: If you attempt to delete a sync configuration but still reach the limit with the next addition before AWS has completed the delete operation.

## How to Handle ResourceDataSyncCountExceededException

Handling this exception involves a few strategic steps:

1. **Review Current Configurations**: Before creating a new sync configuration, review your existing ones. You can use the following code snippet to list current configurations.

   ```java
   import com.amazonaws.services.simplesystemsmanagement.AWSSimpleSystemsManagement;
   import com.amazonaws.services.simplesystemsmanagement.AWSSimpleSystemsManagementClientBuilder;
   import com.amazonaws.services.simplesystemsmanagement.model.ListResourceDataSyncRequest;
   import com.amazonaws.services.simplesystemsmanagement.model.ListResourceDataSyncResult;

   public class ListSyncConfigurations {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           AWSSimpleSystemsManagement ssmClient = AWSSimpleSystemsManagementClientBuilder.standard().build();

           ListResourceDataSyncRequest request = new ListResourceDataSyncRequest();
           ListResourceDataSyncResult result = ssmClient.listResourceDataSync(request);

           result.getResourceDataSyncItems().forEach(sync -> {
               System.out.println("Sync Configuration: " + sync.getS3Destination().getBucketName());
           });
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Delete Unused Configurations**: If you find that you have configurations that are no longer necessary, you can delete them using the following code snippet.

   ```java
   import com.amazonaws.services.simplesystemsmanagement.model.DeleteResourceDataSyncRequest;

   public class DeleteSyncConfiguration {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           AWSSimpleSystemsManagement ssmClient = AWSSimpleSystemsManagementClientBuilder.standard().build();

           String syncName = "MyOldSyncConfiguration"; // Name of the sync configuration to delete
           DeleteResourceDataSyncRequest deleteRequest = new DeleteResourceDataSyncRequest()
                   .withSyncName(syncName);
           ssmClient.deleteResourceDataSync(deleteRequest);
           System.out.println("Deleted Sync Configuration: " + syncName);
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Implementing a Robust Monitoring Solution**: To prevent hitting the limit, consider implementing a monitoring solution that alerts you before you reach the maximum limit. Utilizing AWS CloudWatch along with SNS can help you stay informed.

4. **Consider Using Alternate Solutions**: If your use case demands more than 100 sync configurations, evaluate whether you can consolidate your data sources or use alternate methods of data synchronization.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the `ResourceDataSyncCountExceededException` is an important exception to understand for effective management of AWS SSM’s Resource Data Sync feature. By keeping track of your existing configurations, efficiently deleting those that are no longer needed, and proactively monitoring your sync configurations, you can mitigate the risks of encountering this exception and maintain a streamlined operations strategy within your AWS environment.
