Are you looking to optimize your serverless workflows with AWS Step Functions? Look no further! In this article, we will dive deep into a common error you might encounter when working with Step Functions â€“ the `InvalidOutputException`. We will explore what causes this exception, how to prevent it, and how to handle it when it occurs.

## Introduction to AWS Step Functions

AWS Step Functions is a fully-managed workflow service that enables you to coordinate and visualize a series of tasks or steps as a state machine. It simplifies the process of building scalable, distributed applications and allows you to focus on writing the actual workflow logic. Step Functions provides a graphical interface to design and visualize your workflows, making it easy to understand and maintain complex workflows.

## Understanding the `InvalidOutputException`

The `InvalidOutputException` is a common error that occurs when executing a Step Functions state machine. This exception is thrown when the output of a state, returned by an activity or a subflow, does not match the expected schema declared in your Step Functions definition.

### What causes the `InvalidOutputException`?

The `InvalidOutputException` occurs when there is a mismatch between the expected output schema and the actual output produced by a state. The expected schema is defined using JSON schema syntax and allows you to enforce the structure and data types of the output.

When a state produces output, Step Functions validates the output against the defined schema. If the output doesn't match the schema, a `InvalidOutputException` is thrown, indicating that the output is invalid.

### Handling the `InvalidOutputException`

To handle the `InvalidOutputException`, you need to ensure that the output produced by each state matches the defined schema. There are several steps you can take to prevent or handle this exception effectively:

#### 1. Define a clear and accurate output schema

Spend some time designing and defining the output schema for each state. Clearly define the expected structure, data types, and any validation rules. This will help both the state machine developers and consumers of the output to understand the expected format.

#### 2. Use JSON schema validation during development

Leverage JSON schema validation tools to ensure that the output produced by each state is compliant with the defined schema during development. Tools such as [ajv](https://ajv.js.org/) and [jsonschema](https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/) can be invaluable in validating the output before running it in Step Functions.

#### 3. Utilize Step Functions input and output templates

Step Functions allows you to define input and output templates for each state, which can be used to transform the input and output data. These templates can help normalize the data produced by each state and ensure it matches the expected schema. Use them to transform the output of states before passing them to subsequent states.

#### 4. Implement error handling and fallback mechanisms

If you suspect that the output of a particular state might not always conform to the expected schema, consider implementing error handling mechanisms. You can catch the `InvalidOutputException`, log the error, and execute fallback logic or notify the appropriate stakeholders, ensuring your workflow remains resilient.

### Example: Validating Output in AWS Step Functions

Let's take a look at an example where we encountered the `InvalidOutputException` and how we handled it. Consider the following state machine definition:

```json
{
  "Comment": "A sample state machine",
  "StartAt": "ValidateData",
  "States": {
    "ValidateData": {
      "Type": "Task",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:validateDataLambda",
      "OutputPath": "$.validatedData",
      "ResultPath": "$.validatedData",
      "Next": "ProcessData"
    },
    "ProcessData": {
      "Type": "Task",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:processDataLambda"
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the `ValidateData` state invokes a Lambda function (`validateDataLambda`) to validate the input data. The output of this state is stored in the `.validatedData` field.

To prevent the `InvalidOutputException`, we defined the output schema for the `ValidateData` state as follows:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "validatedData": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "name": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "age": {
          "type": "number"
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "name",
        "age"
      ]
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "validatedData"
  ]
}
```

This schema enforces that the output of the `validateDataLambda` function contains `name` and `age` properties of specific data types.

## Conclusion

Validating the output produced by states in AWS Step Functions is crucial for the successful execution of your workflows. By understanding the `InvalidOutputException` and following the best practices discussed in this article, you can ensure that your state machine produces valid and consistent results. Remember, defining clear output schemas, using JSON schema validation tools, leveraging input and output templates, and implementing error handling mechanisms are key to handling the `InvalidOutputException` effectively.

Keep these best practices in mind while designing and developing your Step Functions workflows, and you'll be well on your way to building robust and scalable serverless applications with AWS Step Functions.
