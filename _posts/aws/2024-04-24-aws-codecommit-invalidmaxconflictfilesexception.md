## Introduction
Welcome to another article in our series on AWS CodeCommit! In this article, we will discuss the `InvalidMaxConflictFilesException` of the `com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.model` library. CodeCommit is a fully-managed source control service that makes it easy for teams to collaborate on code in a secure and scalable manner.

## What is `InvalidMaxConflictFilesException`?
The `InvalidMaxConflictFilesException` is an exception thrown by the AWS CodeCommit service when the specified value for maximum conflict files is invalid. This exception is part of the CodeCommit API, specifically within the `com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.model` package, which provides a Java interface for working with the CodeCommit service.

## Understanding Conflicts in Code Commit
Before we dive into the details of the `InvalidMaxConflictFilesException`, let's have a brief understanding of conflicts in Code Commit. Conflicts occur when multiple developers modify the same file in a Git repository simultaneously and try to merge their changes. When conflicts arise, CodeCommit marks those files as conflicting and informs the developers. Resolving these conflicts requires manual intervention, either by merging the changes or choosing one version over another.

## Handling `InvalidMaxConflictFilesException`
The `InvalidMaxConflictFilesException` is thrown when an invalid value is provided for the maximum number of conflict files in a merge operation. The maximum number of conflict files parameter specifies the maximum number of conflicting files that can be generated during a merge. If the provided value is out of the allowed range, CodeCommit throws this exception.

To demonstrate, let's take a look at the following code snippet:

```java
try {
    // Perform a merge operation here
} catch (InvalidMaxConflictFilesException ex) {
    // Handle the exception here
}
```

In this example, we're attempting to perform a merge operation, and if an `InvalidMaxConflictFilesException` is thrown, we can catch it and handle it accordingly. Depending on your application's requirements, you can choose to retry the operation with a valid value or display an error message to the user.

## Example Scenario
To provide a practical example, consider a scenario where your team uses AWS CodeCommit for version control, and you have a merge operation that frequently triggers `InvalidMaxConflictFilesException`. Upon investigation, you realize that the default maximum conflict files value is not suitable for your project's requirements. You decide to adjust the value to better suit your needs and handle the exception gracefully.

To change the maximum conflict files value, you can use the AWS CLI. Here's an example command:

```bash
aws codecommit update-pull-request-approval-rule-template --approval-rule-template-name my-template --conflict-resolution-strategy OVERRIDE fromBlob --maximum-conflict-files 10
```

In this example, we use the `update-pull-request-approval-rule-template` command to modify the conflict resolution strategy and maximum conflict files value for a pull request approval rule template. We set the maximum number of conflict files to 10, but you can adjust this value based on your specific requirements.

## Conclusion
In this article, we explored the `InvalidMaxConflictFilesException` of the `com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.model` library in AWS CodeCommit. We discussed the significance of conflicts in code commits and how to handle this exception when encountered. By understanding this exception, you can effectively handle it and adjust the maximum conflict files value to suit your needs.
