## What is AWS CodeCommit?

AWS CodeCommit is a fully-managed source control service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows developers to securely store and manage their source code in the cloud, providing an alternative to self-hosted version control systems like Git or Subversion.

CodeCommit offers various features, such as high availability, scalability, and enhanced security. It integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, including AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeDeploy, enabling a seamless DevOps workflow.

## Understanding the InvalidMaxConflictFilesException

The `InvalidMaxConflictFilesException` is an exception class defined in the `com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.model` package of the AWS SDK for Java. It represents an error that occurs when the maximum number of conflict files allowed in a merge or pull request exceeds the limit set by AWS CodeCommit.

When this exception is thrown, it indicates that you need to adjust the maximum allowed conflict file limit to complete the merge or pull request operation successfully.

## Causes of the InvalidMaxConflictFilesException

The `InvalidMaxConflictFilesException` typically occurs when you attempt to perform a merge or pull request in CodeCommit and the number of conflicting files between the source and destination branches exceeds the configured limit.

By default, CodeCommit imposes a limit on the maximum number of conflict files allowed in a merge or pull request. If this limit is exceeded, the `InvalidMaxConflictFilesException` is thrown.

## How to Resolve InvalidMaxConflictFilesException

To resolve the `InvalidMaxConflictFilesException`, you need to adjust the maximum number of conflict files allowed by CodeCommit. The process involves modifying the repository settings using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDK.

Here's an example of how to update the maximum conflict file limit using the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws codecommit update-repository \
    --repository-name MyRepo \
    --max-conflict-files 50
```

In this example, we're updating the maximum conflict file limit of the `MyRepo` repository to 50. Adjust the value according to your specific requirements.

Alternatively, you can also update the repository settings via the AWS Management Console or programmatically using the AWS SDK for your preferred programming language.

## Conclusion

The `InvalidMaxConflictFilesException` in AWS CodeCommit can be easily resolved by adjusting the maximum allowed conflict file limit. By understanding the causes of this exception and following the steps to resolve it, you can ensure smoother merges and pull requests in your CodeCommit repository.

Remember to review your repository settings and increase the maximum conflict file limit, if necessary, to avoid encountering this exception in the future.

CodeCommit offers a user-friendly interface and integrates well with other AWS DevOps tools, making it an excellent choice for hosting and managing your source code in the cloud.
