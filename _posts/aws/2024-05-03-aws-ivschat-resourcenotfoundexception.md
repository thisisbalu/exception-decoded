    try {
        ListMembersRequest request = new ListMembersRequest()
            .withChannelArn(channelArn);
            
        ListMembersResult result = ivsChatClient.listMembers(request);
        
        // Process the members list
        List<Member> members = result.getMembers();
        for (Member member : members) {
            System.out.println("Member Name: " + member.getName());
            System.out.println("Member ID: " + member.getId());
        }
    } catch (ResourceNotFoundException e) {
        System.err.println("Error: The specified channel does not exist!");
    }
}
```

### Example 2: Sending a Chat Message

```java
public void sendChatMessage(String channelArn, String message) {
    try {
        SendMessageRequest request = new SendMessageRequest()
            .withChannelArn(channelArn)
            .withContent(message);
            
        SendMessageResult result = ivsChatClient.sendMessage(request);
        
        System.out.println("Message sent successfully!");
    } catch (ResourceNotFoundException e) {
