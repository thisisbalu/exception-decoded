**Introduction**

Are you struggling to keep track of your AWS costs? Do you find it challenging to identify the exact sources eating up your budget? Look no further! AWS Cost Explorer is the perfect tool to visualize, analyze, and optimize your AWS spending. However, encountering an `UnknownMonitorException` error can hinder your cost monitoring experience. In this article, we will dive deep into the `com.amazonaws.services.costexplorer.model.UnknownMonitorException`, understand its causes, and explore possible solutions.

**Understanding the UnknownMonitorException**

The `UnknownMonitorException` is a specific exception class defined in the `com.amazonaws.services.costexplorer.model` package of the AWS SDK. When leveraging the AWS Cost Explorer service to monitor your AWS costs programmatically, this exception might be thrown under certain circumstances. The exception typically occurs when an unrecognized monitor identifier is requested or supplied.

**Common Causes**

Below are some common causes for encountering the `UnknownMonitorException`:

1. **Incorrect Monitor Identifier**: The exception is commonly thrown when an incorrect, non-existent, or unrecognized monitor identifier is provided while attempting to retrieve cost information.

2. **Outdated AWS SDK**: To avoid compatibility issues, ensure that you are using the latest version of the AWS SDK. Older versions of the SDK might not support new monitor identifiers, resulting in the exception being thrown.

3. **Deleted Monitor**: The exception can also be thrown if you attempt to access a monitor that has been deleted. Ensure that the monitor you are requesting still exists in the AWS Cost Explorer dashboard.

**Handling the UnknownMonitorException**

To handle the `UnknownMonitorException` gracefully, follow these steps:

1. **Check Monitor Identifiers**: Verify that the monitor identifier passed as a parameter to the relevant AWS Cost Explorer API call is correct and exists in your AWS Cost Explorer dashboard. A typographical error or an outdated identifier might be the cause of the exception.

2. **Update the AWS SDK**: Ensure that you are using the latest version of the AWS SDK. By keeping your SDK up to date, you can leverage the latest features and prevent compatibility issues, including `UnknownMonitorException` occurrences.

3. **Validate Monitor Existence**: Before making any AWS Cost Explorer API calls related to a particular monitor, validate the existence of the monitor. You can achieve this by querying the available monitors through the AWS Cost Explorer APIs.

**Code Examples**

Let's explore some code examples to better understand how to handle the `UnknownMonitorException` and retrieve cost information successfully:

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.costexplorer.*;
import com.amazonaws.services.costexplorer.model.*;

public class CostMonitorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AWSCostExplorer costExplorer = AWSCostExplorerClientBuilder.defaultClient();
        
        String monitorId = "my-monitor-id";
        
        try {
            GetCostAndUsageRequest request = new GetCostAndUsageRequest()
                .withTimePeriod(new DateInterval().withStart("2022-01-01").withEnd("2022-01-31"))
                .withGranularity(Granularity.MONTHLY)
                .withFilter(new Expression().withDimensions(new DimensionValues().withKey("USAGE_TYPE_GROUP").withValues("EC2: Running Hours")))
                .withMetrics("BlendedCost")
                .withMonitor(monitorId); // Monitor ID
            GetCostAndUsageResult result = costExplorer.getCostAndUsage(request);
            // Process the cost data
        } catch (UnknownMonitorException e) {
            // Handle the UnknownMonitorException
        }
    }
}
```

In the above Java code example, we attempt to retrieve cost and usage information for a specific monitor. The `UnknownMonitorException` is caught, allowing us to handle the exception appropriately.
