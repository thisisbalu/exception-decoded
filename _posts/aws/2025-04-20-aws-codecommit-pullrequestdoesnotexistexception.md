AWS CodeCommit is a fully managed source control service hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It provides a platform for version control of code repositories, allowing developers to collaborate on projects with ease. However, as with any service, users may encounter exceptions that can hinder their development process. One such exception is `PullRequestDoesNotExistException`.

In this article, we will dive deep into the `PullRequestDoesNotExistException`, its causes, how to handle it in your AWS CodeCommit integrations, and practical code examples to navigate through error management.

## What is PullRequestDoesNotExistException?

`PullRequestDoesNotExistException` is an exception thrown by AWS CodeCommit when an attempt is made to retrieve a pull request that does not exist. This can occur for various reasons, including:

- The pull request ID provided is incorrect.
- The pull request has been deleted.
- The pull request is from a different repository than the one being queried.

When this exception is encountered, it typically indicates that the identifier used to reference the pull request does not correspond to any existing pull requests in the specified repository.

## Causes of PullRequestDoesNotExistException

Understanding the causes of `PullRequestDoesNotExistException` is crucial for debugging and fixing issues in your applications. Here are some common scenarios that lead to this exception:

1. **Invalid Pull Request ID**: If you pass an incorrect pull request ID, the system will not find any match.
2. **Deleted Pull Request**: If the pull request has been removed from the repository, any subsequent calls that reference it will result in this exception.
3. **Cross-Repository Calls**: Attempting to access pull requests across different repositories can lead to this error, as each repository maintains its own set of pull requests.

## How to Handle the Exception in Your Code

### Using AWS SDK for Java

If you're using the AWS SDK for Java, you'll need to catch the `PullRequestDoesNotExistException` to handle it gracefully in your application. Hereâ€™s an example of how to do this:

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.AWSCodeCommit;
import com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.AWSCodeCommitClientBuilder;
import com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.model.GetPullRequestRequest;
import com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.model.GetPullRequestResult;
import com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.model.PullRequestDoesNotExistException;

public class CodeCommitExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AWSCodeCommit codeCommit = AWSCodeCommitClientBuilder.defaultClient();
        
        String pullRequestId = "example-pull-request-id";
        
        try {
            GetPullRequestRequest request = new GetPullRequestRequest().withPullRequestId(pullRequestId);
            GetPullRequestResult result = codeCommit.getPullRequest(request);
            System.out.println("Pull request details: " + result.getPullRequest());
        } catch (PullRequestDoesNotExistException e) {
            System.err.println("Error: The specified pull request does not exist.");
            // Handle the error, e.g., log it, alert the user, etc.
        }
    }
}
```

### Using AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)

In Python, using Boto3, the handling would be similar, albeit with Python syntax:

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError

def get_pull_request(pull_request_id):
    codecommit = boto3.client('codecommit')

    try:
        response = codecommit.get_pull_request(pullRequestId=pull_request_id)
        print("Pull request details:", response['pullRequest'])
    except codecommit.exceptions.PullRequestDoesNotExistException:
        print("Error: The specified pull request does not exist.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pull_request_id = 'example-pull-request-id'
    get_pull_request(pull_request_id)
```

### Catching Multiple Exceptions

Both AWS SDKs allow you to catch multiple exceptions as follows, if you'd like to handle situations more comprehensively:

```java
try {
    // Your CodeCommit request code here
} catch (PullRequestDoesNotExistException e) {
    System.err.println("Pull request not found.");
} catch (AnotherRelevantException e) {
    System.err.println("Another exception occurred.");
}
```

## Best Practices for Avoiding the Exception

1. **Validate Input**: Always ensure that the pull request ID or other inputs are validated before making service calls.
2. **Check Deletion Status**: If you're managing pull requests, implement logic to check if a pull request was deleted before attempting to retrieve its details.
3. **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement robust logging and monitoring to capture occurrences of this exception. It can help in diagnosing issues promptly.
4. **Use Try-Catch Blocks**: Always wrap your AWS CodeCommit calls within try-catch blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.

## Conclusion

`PullRequestDoesNotExistException` in AWS CodeCommit is an exception that developers need to be aware of when working with pull requests. Understanding its causes and best practices for error handling can significantly improve the resilience of your applications. By implementing proper validation and error management techniques, developers can ensure a smoother workflow and enhance their integration with AWS CodeCommit.
