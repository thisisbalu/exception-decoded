Are you using AWS License ManagerLinuxSubscriptions for managing your software licenses? If yes, then you might have come across the ValidationException. In this article, we will explore this exception in detail, understand its usage, and learn how to handle it effectively.

## What is the ValidationException?

The ValidationException is an error that can occur while working with the com.amazonaws.services.licensemanagerlinuxsubscriptions.model package in AWS License ManagerLinuxSubscriptions. This exception is thrown when the validation rules for a particular operation are not met.

## How does ValidationException occur?

ValidationException can occur in various scenarios. It can be triggered when performing operations like creating, updating, or deleting resources related to license subscriptions. Here are a few situations where you might come across this exception:

1. **Invalid Input Data**: When the input data provided for an operation is invalid or missing required fields, the ValidationException is thrown. For example, if you attempt to create a license subscription without specifying the required attributes like licenseArn or subscriptionName, the exception will be raised.

2. **Permission Issues**: If the user or role performing the operation lacks the necessary permissions to access or modify the license subscriptions, the ValidationException is thrown. Ensure that the user or role has the appropriate IAM permissions to avoid encountering this exception.

3. **Incompatible Changes**: If you are updating a license subscription with incompatible changes, such as changing the productSKU or licenseArn, the ValidationException is thrown. Make sure to review the allowed modifications for each operation to avoid this issue.

## Handling the ValidationException

When dealing with the ValidationException, it is crucial to handle it gracefully to prevent disruptions in your application flow. Here are a few approaches to effectively handle this exception:

### 1. Catch and Log the Exception

Surround the code block that may throw the ValidationException with a try-catch block. When the exception occurs, catch it and log the details for further analysis. You can use popular logging frameworks like Log4j or SLF4J to capture the exception details.

```java
try {
    // Code block that may throw the ValidationException
} catch (ValidationException e) {
    // Log the exception for troubleshooting
    logger.error("ValidationException occurred: {}", e.getMessage());
}
```

### 2. Handle Specific Validation Errors

The ValidationException can contain specific error messages that can help you identify the exact cause of the validation failure. You can handle these errors individually based on your application requirements.

```java
try {
    // Code block that may throw the ValidationException
} catch (ValidationException e) {
    if (e.getMessage().contains("licenseArn")) {
        // Handle error related to licenseArn
    } else if (e.getMessage().contains("subscriptionName")) {
        // Handle error related to subscriptionName
    } else {
        // Handle other validation errors
    }
}
```

### 3. Provide User-Friendly Feedback

When the ValidationException occurs, you can inform the user about the error in a user-friendly manner. Display a meaningful message explaining the validation failure and guide the user to correct their input data or permissions.

```java
try {
    // Code block that may throw the ValidationException
} catch (ValidationException e) {
    if (e.getMessage().contains("licenseArn")) {
        // Display message for invalid licenseArn
        System.out.println("Invalid licenseArn value. Please provide a valid licenseArn.");
    } else if (e.getMessage().contains("subscriptionName")) {
        // Display message for invalid subscriptionName
        System.out.println("Invalid subscriptionName value. Please provide a valid subscriptionName.");
    } else {
        // Display generic validation error message
        System.out.println("Validation error occurred. Please check your input data and try again.");
    }
}
```
