## Introduction

In the realm of collaborative document management systems, AWS WorkDocs has emerged as a powerful solution. As an integral part of the AWS ecosystem, WorkDocs provides organizations with the ability to store, share, and collaborate on files securely. To facilitate seamless collaboration, AWS WorkDocs integrates a sophisticated version control system. However, in scenarios where multiple users are trying to upload a document concurrently, conflicts may arise. This is when the `DraftUploadOutOfSyncException` of `com.amazonaws.services.workdocs.model` comes into play.

In this article, we will delve into the `DraftUploadOutOfSyncException` and explore how to handle conflicts that occur during document uploads in AWS WorkDocs.

## Understanding the DraftUploadOutOfSyncException

The `DraftUploadOutOfSyncException` is an exception that is thrown when an upload request fails due to conflicts with an existing draft of the document. This exception primarily occurs when multiple users simultaneously attempt to upload changes to the same document.

When a document is in the "draft" state, it effectively means that it is being actively edited or modified by one or more users. In such cases, WorkDocs needs a mechanism to handle conflicts that may arise when multiple versions of the document are being uploaded concurrently.

The `DraftUploadOutOfSyncException` is designed specifically for this purpose. It provides information about the reason for the failure and helps in resolving conflicts appropriately, ensuring data integrity within the WorkDocs system.

## Handling the DraftUploadOutOfSyncException

To handle `DraftUploadOutOfSyncException` effectively, the following steps are typically followed:

### 1. Identifying the Exception

When an upload request fails due to the `DraftUploadOutOfSyncException`, it is necessary to identify this exception within the code. Let's take a look at an example:

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.workdocs.model.DraftUploadOutOfSyncException;

try {
    // Perform the document upload
} catch (DraftUploadOutOfSyncException e) {
    // Handle the exception
}
```

### 2. Resolving the Conflict

Once the exception is identified, the next step involves resolving the conflict. The `DraftUploadOutOfSyncException` provides valuable information that can be used to determine the cause of the conflict and make informed decisions to resolve it.

One common approach to resolve a conflict is by merging the changes made by different users. Here's an example of how this can be achieved:

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.workdocs.model.DescribeDocumentVersionsRequest;
import com.amazonaws.services.workdocs.model.DescribeDocumentVersionsResult;
import com.amazonaws.services.workdocs.model.DocumentVersionMetadata;

// Get the metadata of the document
DescribeDocumentVersionsRequest request = new DescribeDocumentVersionsRequest()
    .withDocumentId("documentId");
DescribeDocumentVersionsResult result = workDocsClient.describeDocumentVersions(request);
List<DocumentVersionMetadata> versions = result.getDocumentVersions();

// Identify conflicting versions
DocumentVersionMetadata conflictingVersion = null;
for (DocumentVersionMetadata version : versions) {
    if (version.getContentType().equals("conflict")) {
        conflictingVersion = version;
        break;
    }
}

// Merge the conflicting versions
if (conflictingVersion != null) {
    // Perform the merge operation
    // ...
}
```

### 3. Retry the Upload

After resolving the conflict, the document upload can be retried to ensure a successful upload. This may involve updating the existing draft with the merged changes or creating a new draft altogether.

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.workdocs.model.UpdateDocumentVersionRequest;

// Update the existing draft with merged changes
UpdateDocumentVersionRequest request = new UpdateDocumentVersionRequest()
    .withDocumentId("documentId")
    .withVersionId("draftVersionId")
    .withVersionStatus(DocumentVersionStatus.ACTIVE);
workDocsClient.updateDocumentVersion(request);
```

Alternatively, you can create a new draft by making another upload request with the changes. The document ID and the parent folder ID should be provided in the request.

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.workdocs.model.UploadDocumentVersionRequest;

// Create a new draft with merged changes
UploadDocumentVersionRequest request = new UploadDocumentVersionRequest()
    .withDocumentId("documentId")
    .withParentFolderId("folderId")
    .withContent(new InputStream())
    .withContentType("application/pdf");
workDocsClient.uploadDocumentVersion(request);
```

## Conclusion

With the increasing demand for collaborative document management systems, the integration of version control has become crucial. AWS WorkDocs addresses this need by providing the `DraftUploadOutOfSyncException` to handle conflicts during document uploads.

In this article, we explored the `DraftUploadOutOfSyncException` and the steps involved in handling it effectively. Resolving conflicts and retrying the upload ensures a seamless experience for users collaborating on the same document.
