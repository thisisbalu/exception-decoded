## Introduction
Welcome to this detailed guide on understanding and handling the `ResourceNotFoundException` in the AWS Kinesis Video WebRTC Storage. In this article, we will provide insights into what this exception is, scenarios in which it typically occurs, and how you can effectively handle it using code examples.

## What is the ResourceNotFoundException?
The `ResourceNotFoundException` is an exception that occurs when the requested resource is not found within the AWS Kinesis Video WebRTC Storage. This exception is often encountered when attempting to access or manipulate a specific resource that does not exist or has been deleted.

Handling this exception is crucial, as it allows your application to gracefully handle scenarios where requested resources are not available, minimizing the impact on end-users and improving overall system stability.

## Common Scenarios
Let's explore a few common scenarios in which the `ResourceNotFoundException` might occur:

### 1. Non-existent Stream
One of the most common causes of this exception is when you try to access a Kinesis Video WebRTC Stream that does not exist in your AWS account. This might be due to a typo in the stream name or because the stream has been deleted.

```java
AmazonKinesisVideoWebRTC client = AmazonKinesisVideoWebRTCClientBuilder.defaultClient();
DescribeStreamRequest describeStreamRequest = new DescribeStreamRequest()
    .withStreamName("nonexistent-stream");

try {
    DescribeStreamResult describeStreamResult = client.describeStream(describeStreamRequest);
    // Handle successful response here
} catch (ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
    // Handle the exception
}
```

### 2. Invalid Stream ARN
Another scenario is when you attempt to perform an operation using an invalid ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for a Kinesis Video WebRTC Stream. This can occur if the ARN is malformed or does not correspond to any existing stream.

```java
AmazonKinesisVideoWebRTC client = AmazonKinesisVideoWebRTCClientBuilder.defaultClient();
GetIceServerConfigRequest iceServerConfigRequest = new GetIceServerConfigRequest()
    .withChannelARN("invalid-stream-arn");

try {
    GetIceServerConfigResult iceServerConfigResult = client.getIceServerConfig(iceServerConfigRequest);
    // Handle successful response here
} catch (ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
    // Handle the exception
}
```

### 3. Deleted Resource
When you try to manipulate a resource that has been recently deleted, the `ResourceNotFoundException` will be raised. This can occur if you attempt to perform operations on a deleted Kinesis Video WebRTC stream or any associated resources.

```java
AmazonKinesisVideoWebRTC client = AmazonKinesisVideoWebRTCClientBuilder.defaultClient();
DeleteStreamRequest deleteStreamRequest = new DeleteStreamRequest()
    .withStreamName("deleted-stream");

try {
    DeleteStreamResult deleteStreamResult = client.deleteStream(deleteStreamRequest);
    // Handle successful response here
} catch (ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
    // Handle the exception
}
```

## Handling the ResourceNotFoundException
Now that you understand some of the common scenarios in which the `ResourceNotFoundException` occurs, let's explore how you can effectively handle it in your code.

When catching the exception, you can utilize the information provided within the exception message to determine the cause and take appropriate actions. Additionally, you can provide clear error messages to your users or log the exception details for further troubleshooting.

```java
try {
    // Kinesis Video WebRTC operation
} catch (ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
    String errorMessage = "The requested resource was not found. Reason: " + ex.getMessage();
    // Return the error message to the user or log it as needed.
}
```

By implementing a proper error-handling mechanism, you can ensure your application gracefully handles the `ResourceNotFoundException` and provides meaningful feedback to the users.
