## Introduction to CustomDBEngineVersionAlreadyExistsException
The `CustomDBEngineVersionAlreadyExistsException` is a specific exception that occurs when attempting to create a new custom DB Engine version in Amazon RDS. This exception is defined within the `com.amazonaws.services.rds.model` package of the AWS SDK. It indicates that the specified version of the custom DB engine already exists for the particular engine name.

## Key Causes of CustomDBEngineVersionAlreadyExistsException
The primary reason behind the occurrence of the `CustomDBEngineVersionAlreadyExistsException` is attempting to create a custom DB engine version with a version number that is already in use. To further illustrate, let's say you want to create a custom DB engine version for MySQL 5.7.30, and if this version already exists, the exception will be thrown.

## Resolving CustomDBEngineVersionAlreadyExistsException
To overcome the `CustomDBEngineVersionAlreadyExistsException`, you have two options, as described below.

### Option 1: Update the Existing Custom DB Engine Version
One way to tackle this exception is by updating the existing custom DB engine version. You can do this by incrementing the version number or making any necessary modifications to the existing version. By updating the version, you can maintain the desired functionality without encountering the exception.

### Option 2: Delete the Existing Custom DB Engine Version
If the existing custom DB engine version is no longer needed or if you wish to start afresh, you can delete the current version. Once deleted, you can recreate the custom DB engine version without facing the exception. However, exercise caution when deleting a custom DB engine version, as it may impact other parts of your system that rely on it.

## Code Examples
To provide a better understanding of the `CustomDBEngineVersionAlreadyExistsException` and its resolution, let's consider a couple of code examples.

### Example 1: Describe DB Engine Versions
```java
AmazonRDS rdsClient = AmazonRDSClientBuilder.defaultClient();
DescribeDBEngineVersionsRequest request = new DescribeDBEngineVersionsRequest()
    .withEngine("mysql");
DescribeDBEngineVersionsResult result = rdsClient.describeDBEngineVersions(request);

for (DBEngineVersionDescription version : result.getDBEngineVersions()) {
    System.out.println("DB Engine Version: " + version.getEngineVersion());
}
```
In this example, we are using the AWS SDK for Java to describe all available DB engine versions for MySQL. This will help you ensure that the desired custom DB engine version doesn't already exist before attempting to create it.

### Example 2: Create Custom DB Engine Version
```java
AmazonRDS rdsClient = AmazonRDSClientBuilder.defaultClient();
CreateDBEngineVersionRequest request = new CreateDBEngineVersionRequest()
    .withEngine("mysql")
    .withEngineVersion("5.7.30")
    .withDBEngineDescription("Custom MySQL 5.7.30 engine version")
    .withDBParameterGroupFamily("mysql5.7");
CreateDBEngineVersionResult result = rdsClient.createDBEngineVersion(request);
```
In this example, we demonstrate the process of creating a custom DB engine version for MySQL 5.7.30. Ensure that you specify a unique version number in order to avoid the `CustomDBEngineVersionAlreadyExistsException`.

## Conclusion
To summarize, the `CustomDBEngineVersionAlreadyExistsException` in `com.amazonaws.services.rds.model` package is triggered when attempting to create a custom DB engine version that already exists. While this exception may impede your progress, it can be addressed by either updating the existing version or deleting it from your Amazon RDS instance. By following the examples and suggestions provided in this guide, you can successfully avoid and resolve this exception, enabling smooth execution of your AWS RDS tasks.
