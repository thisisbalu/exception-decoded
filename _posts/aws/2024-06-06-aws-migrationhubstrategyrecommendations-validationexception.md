## Introduction

AWS Migration Hub Strategy Recommendations is a powerful service that provides insights and recommendations for optimizing the strategy of your migration projects. However, as with any complex system, there may be times when you encounter errors or exceptions. In this article, we will take a close look at one such exception - `ValidationException` - and explore its causes, implications, and possible ways to handle it.

## What is ValidationException?

`ValidationException` is an exception class within the `com.amazonaws.services.migrationhubstrategyrecommendations.model` package that is thrown when there is an issue with the validation of input parameters or data within AWS Migration Hub Strategy Recommendations.

## Causes of ValidationException

A `ValidationException` can occur due to several reasons. Let's explore some common scenarios where this exception might be thrown:

1. ### Missing Required Parameters

   One possible cause is when required parameters are missing in the API call. For example, if you are creating a strategy recommendation, the `createRecommendation` method expects certain parameters to be provided. If one or more of these required parameters are missing, a `ValidationException` will be thrown.

   Here's an example of how a `ValidationException` can occur due to missing parameters:

   ```java
   try {
       CreateRecommendationRequest request = new CreateRecommendationRequest()
                                                .withSourceApplication("my-app")
                                                .withTargetApplication("my-app")
                                                .withMigrationStrategy("Cutover");

       CreateRecommendationResult result = migrationHubStrategyRecommendationsClient.createRecommendation(request);

       // Further processing of result
   } catch (ValidationException e) {
       // Handle ValidationException
   }
   ```

   In the above code, the `createRecommendation` method requires additional parameters like `migrationSourceId` and `migrationTargetId`. If these parameters are not provided, a `ValidationException` will be thrown.

2. ### Invalid Parameter Values

   Another reason for a `ValidationException` is when the input parameters provided are invalid or fail to meet the expected criteria. This could be due to incorrect data types, exceeding length limits, or violating other constraints defined in the AWS Migration Hub Strategy Recommendations API.

   For instance, if you specify an invalid `migrationStrategy` while creating a recommendation, such as `InvalidStrategy`, a `ValidationException` will be thrown.

   ```java
   try {
       CreateRecommendationRequest request = new CreateRecommendationRequest()
                                                .withSourceApplication("my-app")
                                                .withTargetApplication("my-app")
                                                .withMigrationStrategy("InvalidStrategy")
                                                .withMigrationSourceId("source-123")
                                                .withMigrationTargetId("target-456");

       CreateRecommendationResult result = migrationHubStrategyRecommendationsClient.createRecommendation(request);

       // Further processing of result
   } catch (ValidationException e) {
       // Handle ValidationException
   }
   ```

   In the above example, an invalid `migrationStrategy` value triggers a `ValidationException`.

## Handling ValidationException

When a `ValidationException` occurs, you should handle it gracefully to provide meaningful feedback to users or log the error for troubleshooting purposes. Here are a few strategies for handling `ValidationException`:

- **Returning User-friendly Error Messages**: Catch the `ValidationException` and extract relevant details from the exception object to construct user-friendly messages. For example, you can check the `errorMessage` field of the exception to get more information about why the validation failed.

    ```java
    catch (ValidationException e) {
        String errorMessage = e.getErrorMessage();

        // Log or return the error message to the user interface
    }
    ```

- **Validating Input Parameters Client-side**: To minimize the chances of encountering a `ValidationException` on the server-side, you can perform client-side input validation. This way, you can catch potential errors before making the API call.

- **Referencing AWS Migration Hub Strategy Recommendations API Documentation**: The AWS Migration Hub Strategy Recommendations API documentation provides detailed information on the expected input parameters, their valid values, and any other constraints. By referring to the documentation, you can ensure you are using the correct parameters and meeting the API requirements.

## Conclusion

Understanding and handling exceptions, such as `ValidationException`, is crucial when working with AWS Migration Hub Strategy Recommendations. By being aware of the possible causes and implementing appropriate error handling strategies, you can enhance the overall reliability and user experience of your migration projects.

In this article, we explored the common causes of `ValidationException`, possible ways to handle it, and some best practices to follow. We hope this deep dive into `ValidationException` in AWS Migration Hub Strategy Recommendations has provided you with valuable insights.

Remember, when faced with a `ValidationException`, always dig deeper, review your code, and refer to the official documentation for guidance.
