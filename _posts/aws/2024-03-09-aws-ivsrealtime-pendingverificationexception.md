As technology continues to evolve, live video streaming has become a fundamental part of various applications and services. Amazon IVS Realtime is a cutting-edge solution offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables developers to incorporate live video streaming functionality into their applications seamlessly.

One common challenge faced by developers when working with Amazon IVS Realtime is handling exceptions effectively. In this article, we will delve into one such exception called the `PendingVerificationException`. We will explore its significance, understand its root causes, and provide examples that demonstrate how to handle it in your code.

## What is PendingVerificationException?

The `PendingVerificationException` is an exception class provided by the `com.amazonaws.services.ivsrealtime.model` package in Amazon IVS Realtime. It is thrown when a specific operation encounters an authentication error, known as a pending verification error.

This type of exception is usually encountered when a request is made to perform an action that requires authentication but hasn't been verified yet. In other words, certain operations in Amazon IVS Realtime may involve authentication, such as accessing restricted resources or performing sensitive actions, and until the verification process is completed, the operation cannot proceed.

## Possible Causes of PendingVerificationException

There are several potential causes for encountering a `PendingVerificationException` in Amazon IVS Realtime. Let's examine some common scenarios where this exception may arise:

1. **Unverified access to restricted resources:** When attempting to access certain resources, such as private live video streams or protected API endpoints, Amazon IVS Realtime requires verification of your identity. If the requested action involves such resources and the authentication process has not been completed, you may encounter a `PendingVerificationException`.

2. **Incomplete or expired authentication tokens:** When working with token-based authentication, it is essential to ensure that the provided tokens are valid and complete. If a token is missing or has expired, Amazon IVS Realtime cannot proceed with the requested operation, resulting in a `PendingVerificationException`.

3. **Delayed authentication process:** There might be instances where the authentication process takes longer than usual. In such cases, if an operation depends on the completion of this process but is attempted prematurely, a `PendingVerificationException` may be thrown.

4. **Invalid credentials or permissions:** The authentication process relies on providing accurate and valid credentials or permissions. If any of these credentials are incorrect or insufficient, the verification process cannot be completed, leading to a `PendingVerificationException`.

To mitigate the occurrence of `PendingVerificationException`, it is crucial to thoroughly verify the authentication process and ensure that all relevant steps are properly followed.

## Handling PendingVerificationException

When handling the `PendingVerificationException`, it is necessary to implement appropriate error handling mechanisms in your code. Here is an example demonstrating how to handle the exception gracefully in Java:

```java
try {
    // Perform the operation that may throw the PendingVerificationException
} catch (PendingVerificationException e) {
    // Handle the exception by informing the user and providing instructions on completing the verification process
    System.out.println("Authentication is pending. Please complete the verification process.");
}
```

The above code snippet demonstrates a typical try-catch block where the operation that may throw the `PendingVerificationException` is enclosed within the try block. In the catch block, we handle the exception by displaying a custom message to the user.

When encountering a `PendingVerificationException`, it is crucial to communicate the status of the verification process to the user and guide them on how to complete it. This can be achieved by displaying relevant instructions or redirecting the user to the appropriate verification page.

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored the significance of the `PendingVerificationException` in Amazon IVS Realtime. We discussed its possible causes, including unverified access to restricted resources, incomplete or expired authentication tokens, delayed authentication processes, and invalid credentials or permissions.

To handle the `PendingVerificationException` gracefully, it is essential to implement appropriate error handling mechanisms in your code. By properly informing users about the pending verification status and guiding them through the process, you can ensure a seamless experience.

Remember, authentication is a critical aspect of live video streaming applications, and by efficiently managing the verification process, you can deliver a secure and reliable streaming experience to your users.
