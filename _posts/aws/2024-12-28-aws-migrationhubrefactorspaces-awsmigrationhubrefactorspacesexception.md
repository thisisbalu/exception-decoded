### Example: Catching and Handling the Exception

Below is a simple example in Java to demonstrate how to catch and handle the `AWSMigrationHubRefactorSpacesException`. This code snippet assumes that you have AWS SDK dependencies correctly set up in your Java project.

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.migrationhubrefactorspaces.AWSMigrationHubRefactorSpaces;
import com.amazonaws.services.migrationhubrefactorspaces.AWSMigrationHubRefactorSpacesClientBuilder;
import com.amazonaws.services.migrationhubrefactorspaces.model.AWSMigrationHubRefactorSpacesException;
import com.amazonaws.services.migrationhubrefactorspaces.model.CreateRouteRequest;
import com.amazonaws.services.migrationhubrefactorspaces.model.CreateRouteResult;

public class MigrationHubExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AWSMigrationHubRefactorSpaces migrationHub = AWSMigrationHubRefactorSpacesClientBuilder.defaultClient();

        try {
            CreateRouteRequest createRouteRequest = new CreateRouteRequest()
                    .withRouteName("exampleRoute")
                    .withEnvironmentId("env-123456")
                    .withServiceId("service-123456");

            CreateRouteResult result = migrationHub.createRoute(createRouteRequest);
            System.out.println("Route created successfully: " + result);
        } catch (AWSMigrationHubRefactorSpacesException e) {
            System.err.println("Error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
            System.err.println("Error Code: " + e.getErrorCode());
            System.err.println("Request ID: " + e.getRequestId());
        }
    }
}
```

### Common Causes of AWSMigrationHubRefactorSpacesException

Understanding the common causes of this exception can help prevent pitfalls during development:

1. **Invalid Parameters:** This occurs when required parameters are missing or have invalid values.
2. **Resource Not Found:** The specified environment or service may not exist.
3. **Insufficient Permissions:** The IAM role or user does not have sufficient permissions to perform the requested operation.
4. **Service Limit Exceeded:** You may have exceeded the maximum number of environments or routes allowed in your AWS account.

### Best Practices for Handling the Exception

To handle `AWSMigrationHubRefactorSpacesException` effectively, consider following these best practices:

- **Validate Parameters:** Always validate your parameters before making API calls to reduce invalid parameter errors.
- **Check Resource Existence:** Ensure that the resources you are referencing exist to avoid resource not found exceptions.
- **Implement Retries:** Implement a retry strategy, particularly for transient issues, to improve error resilience.
- **Log Errors:** Use logging to capture error details, which will be invaluable for debugging and troubleshooting.
