## Introduction

When working with AWS Network Manager, it's essential to handle exceptions correctly to ensure the reliability and security of your network infrastructure. One common exception you may encounter is the `ValidationExceptionReason` in `com.amazonaws.services.networkmanager.model`. In this article, we will dive deep into understanding this exception, its possible reasons, and how you can handle it effectively.

## What is a ValidationExceptionReason?

A `ValidationExceptionReason` is an exceptional condition that occurs when the input parameters provided to an AWS Network Manager API request do not meet the required specifications. This exception indicates that the request has failed validation and cannot proceed until the issues are resolved.

## Common Causes of ValidationExceptionReason

### 1. Missing or Incorrect Input

One of the most common reasons for a `ValidationExceptionReason` is missing or incorrect input provided in the API request. For example, if you are creating a new device in Network Manager, you need to provide all the required parameters such as device type, vendor, and model. Failing to provide any of these essential details will result in a `ValidationExceptionReason` with a message indicating the missing input parameter.

```java
CreateDeviceRequest createDeviceRequest = new CreateDeviceRequest()
    .withGlobalNetworkId("globalNetworkId")
    .withDescription("Sample device")
    .withLocation(new Location()
        .withAddress("123 Main Street")
        .withLatitude("37.7749")
        .withLongitude("-122.4194"));

try {
    CreateDeviceResult createDeviceResult = networkManagerClient.createDevice(createDeviceRequest);
} catch (ValidationException e) {
    System.out.println("ValidationExceptionReason: " + e.getReason());
    System.out.println("ValidationExceptionMessage: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

### 2. Invalid Input Format

Another reason for encountering a `ValidationExceptionReason` is providing input data in an invalid format. For example, if you are updating a site in Network Manager and provide an invalid postal code format, the request will fail validation, resulting in this exception.

```java
UpdateSiteRequest updateSiteRequest = new UpdateSiteRequest()
    .withGlobalNetworkId("globalNetworkId")
    .withSiteId("siteId")
    .withDescription("Updated site")
    .withLocation(new Location()
        .withAddress("456 Oak Avenue")
        .withPostalCode("12345-"));

try {
    UpdateSiteResult updateSiteResult = networkManagerClient.updateSite(updateSiteRequest);
} catch (ValidationException e) {
    System.out.println("ValidationExceptionReason: " + e.getReason());
    System.out.println("ValidationExceptionMessage: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

### 3. Inconsistent Relationship

A `ValidationExceptionReason` can also occur when there is an inconsistency or conflict in the relationship between resources. For example, if you are creating a link between two devices that already have a link established, the validation will fail, resulting in this exception.

```java
CreateLinkRequest createLinkRequest = new CreateLinkRequest()
    .withGlobalNetworkId("globalNetworkId")
    .withDescription("Sample link")
    .withSiteId("siteId")
    .withBandwidth(new Bandwidth().withUploadSpeed(1000000).withDownloadSpeed(1000000))
    .withProvider(new Provider().withProviderType("TransitGateway"));

try {
    CreateLinkResult createLinkResult = networkManagerClient.createLink(createLinkRequest);
} catch (ValidationException e) {
    System.out.println("ValidationExceptionReason: " + e.getReason());
    System.out.println("ValidationExceptionMessage: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

## Handling the ValidationExceptionReason

When handling a `ValidationExceptionReason`, it is crucial to examine both the reason and the message provided by the exception. The reason gives you a high-level understanding of why the validation failed, while the message offers additional details on the specific issues encountered.

To handle the exception effectively, you can implement error logging, user-friendly error messages, and input validation on your application side. This way, you can capture and report the errors appropriately, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Conclusion

Understanding the `ValidationExceptionReason` in AWS Network Manager is vital for building robust and error-tolerant applications. By identifying the possible causes and handling the exception effectively, you can enhance the reliability and security of your network infrastructure.

As you continue working with AWS Network Manager, make sure to consult the [official AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/networkmanager/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) for comprehensive information on specific error codes and their resolutions.

Now that you are equipped with the knowledge of `ValidationExceptionReason`, you can confidently troubleshoot and resolve validation issues in your AWS Network Manager applications.

Remember, proper input validation and error handling are key to building scalable and reliable network infrastructure on AWS Network Manager.

Happy coding!
