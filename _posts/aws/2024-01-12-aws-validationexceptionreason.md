## Introduction

AWS Network Manager is a powerful service that simplifies the management of your network resources across multiple AWS accounts and on-premises locations. In this article, we will dive deep into the `ValidationExceptionReason` class of the `com.amazonaws.services.networkmanager.model` package in AWS Network Manager. We will explore its purpose, significance, and how to effectively use it in your applications. So, let's get started!

## What is `ValidationExceptionReason`?

The `ValidationExceptionReason` class is an essential component of the AWS Network Manager API. It represents the possible reasons for a validation exception to occur when interacting with the Network Manager service. This class provides valuable information about what went wrong during the validation process, helping developers to identify and handle errors efficiently.

## Understanding the `ValidationException` Class

Before delving into `ValidationExceptionReason`, let's take a quick look at the `ValidationException` class. This class is thrown when the supplied input fails to satisfy the constraints defined for the API operations in AWS Network Manager. It contains error messages, an error code, and additional metadata to help you troubleshoot and rectify the issues.

The `ValidationException` class has various properties, one of which is `ValidationExceptionReason`. This property holds an enum value that indicates the specific reason for the exception. By accessing this value, you can pinpoint the cause of the validation failure.

## `ValidationExceptionReason` Enum Values

The `ValidationExceptionReason` enum provides a set of predefined values, each representing a specific reason for the exception. Let's explore some of these enums along with the code examples to understand how they can be utilized in different scenarios.

### 1. `MISSING`

The `MISSING` enum is used when a required input parameter is missing from the request. It indicates that the validation failed due to an essential parameter being absent. For instance, consider the following sample code:

```java
CreateGlobalNetworkRequest request = new CreateGlobalNetworkRequest()
    .withDescription("My Global Network");
    
try {
    CreateGlobalNetworkResult result = networkManagerClient.createGlobalNetwork(request);
    // Perform desired operations with the result
} catch (ValidationException e) {
    if (e.getValidationExceptionReason() == ValidationExceptionReason.MISSING) {
        System.out.println("Error: Missing required input parameters");
    }
}
```

In this example, if the `CreateGlobalNetworkRequest` object is missing the required `null` input parameter, the `ValidationException` will be thrown with the `MISSING` reason. We can catch this exception and handle it appropriately, as shown above.

### 2. `MALFORMED`

The `MALFORMED` enum is used when an input parameter is formatted incorrectly, resulting in a validation failure. It indicates that the provided parameter does not meet the expected format or data type. Let's consider a scenario where a malformed `transitGatewayArn` parameter is passed:

```java
AssociateTransitGatewayConnectPeerRequest request = new AssociateTransitGatewayConnectPeerRequest()
    .withTransitGatewayConnectPeerArn("invalid-arn");
    
try {
    AssociateTransitGatewayConnectPeerResult result = networkManagerClient
        .associateTransitGatewayConnectPeer(request);
    // Perform desired operations with the result
} catch (ValidationException e) {
    if (e.getValidationExceptionReason() == ValidationExceptionReason.MALFORMED) {
        System.out.println("Error: Malformed input parameter");
    }
}
```

In this case, the `ValidationException` will be thrown with the `MALFORMED` reason if the `transitGatewayConnectPeerArn` parameter does not adhere to the correct format. By utilizing the `ValidationExceptionReason`, we can easily identify and handle such validation failures.

### 3. `UNKNOWN_ENUM_VALUE`

The `UNKNOWN_ENUM_VALUE` enum is used when an input parameter contains an invalid value. This usually occurs when an enum type parameter is provided with an unrecognized value. Consider the following example:

```java
RegisterTransitGatewayResult
```
