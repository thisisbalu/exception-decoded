In the world of cloud computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has established itself as one of the leading platforms for providing a wide range of cloud services. Among these services, AWS WorkDocs stands out as a powerful collaboration tool that enables teams to securely store, share, and collaborate on documents.

However, while working with AWS WorkDocs, you may come across a situation where the API throws a `ProhibitedStateException`. In this article, we will dive deep into understanding this exception, its implications, and how to handle it effectively in your code.

## What is ProhibitedStateException?

The `ProhibitedStateException` is an exception class defined in the `com.amazonaws.services.workdocs.model` package, specifically for AWS WorkDocs. It is thrown when an API request fails due to a document being in a prohibited state for the intended workflow operation.

In simpler terms, it signifies that the document you are trying to perform an operation on is in a state that doesn't allow the requested action. This could be due to various reasons, such as the document being locked, archived, or pending a specific workflow action.

## Handling ProhibitedStateException

When working with the AWS WorkDocs API, it is essential to handle the `ProhibitedStateException` gracefully in your code. Here's an example that demonstrates how to catch and handle this exception effectively in Java:

```java
try {
    // AWS WorkDocs API call to perform an operation on a document
} catch (ProhibitedStateException e) {
    System.out.println("Unable to perform the operation due to prohibited state: " + e.getMessage());
    // Additional handling logic or error recovery steps
}
```

In the above code snippet, we catch the `ProhibitedStateException` and print a helpful error message to the console. Depending on your application's requirements, you can incorporate additional logic or steps to recover from the exception gracefully.

## Common Causes of ProhibitedStateException

Let's explore some common scenarios that can lead to a `ProhibitedStateException` in AWS WorkDocs:

### 1. Document Locked

One possible cause of `ProhibitedStateException` is when the document you are trying to access or modify is locked. This typically occurs when another user has exclusive access to the document, preventing any further modifications until the lock is released. You can check the document's lock status using the `getDocumentVersion` API and handle the situation accordingly.

```java
// Example code to check the lock status of a document
GetDocumentVersionRequest versionRequest = new GetDocumentVersionRequest()
    .withDocumentId(documentId)
    .withVersionId(versionId);
GetDocumentVersionResult versionResult = workDocsClient.getDocumentVersion(versionRequest);
boolean isLocked = versionResult.getMetadata().getIsLocked();
```

### 2. Document Archived

Another common cause of the `ProhibitedStateException` is when the document is archived. For example, if a document is archived, you cannot perform any active operations on it until it is restored. You can check the archive status using the `getDocument` API and handle the situation accordingly.

```java
// Example code to check the archive status of a document
GetDocumentRequest documentRequest = new GetDocumentRequest()
    .withDocumentId(documentId);
GetDocumentResult documentResult = workDocsClient.getDocument(documentRequest);
boolean isArchived = documentResult.getMetadata().getLatestVersionMetadata().getIsArchived();
```

### 3. Document Awaiting Workflow Action

In some cases, a document may be in a state where it is pending a specific workflow action to proceed further. For example, the document might be awaiting approval or review before it can be modified or shared. You can check the workflow status of a document using the `getDocument` API and handle the situation accordingly.

```java
// Example code to check the workflow status of a document
GetDocumentRequest documentRequest = new GetDocumentRequest()
    .withDocumentId(documentId);
GetDocumentResult documentResult = workDocsClient.getDocument(documentRequest);
String workflowStatus = documentResult.getMetadata().getLatestVersionMetadata().getWorkflowStatus();
```

## Conclusion

In this detailed article, we explored the `ProhibitedStateException` in AWS WorkDocs, its causes, and how to handle it effectively in your code. By incorporating the provided code examples and best practices, you can ensure a smooth workflow when interacting with AWS WorkDocs API.

Remember to always catch and handle the `ProhibitedStateException` gracefully, provide meaningful error messages, and implement appropriate error recovery steps in your applications.
