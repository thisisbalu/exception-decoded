## Introduction
  
AWS WorkDocs is a powerful collaboration service that enables organizations to securely store, share, and collaborate on documents in the cloud. It offers a rich set of APIs to facilitate seamless integration within applications. In this article, we will explore a specific exception, the ProhibitedStateException, in the com.amazonaws.services.workdocs.model package, and understand its significance in the context of AWS WorkDocs.

## Understanding the ProhibitedStateException

The ProhibitedStateException is an exception class provided by the AWS WorkDocs SDK. It is thrown when an operation performed on a resource is not allowed due to its current state. This exception is specifically designed to handle scenarios where a particular action is prohibited based on the state of the resource being operated upon.

## Common Scenarios

Let's take a look at some common scenarios where the ProhibitedStateException may occur:

### 1. Restriction on Deleting a Document

Suppose you attempt to delete a document that is locked for editing by another user. In such a case, the ProhibitedStateException is thrown to indicate that the deletion operation is not allowed due to the document's current locked state. This prevents users from accidentally deleting documents that are being edited by someone else.

Here's an example of how to handle the ProhibitedStateException when deleting a document:

```java
try {
   workDocsClient.deleteDocument(new DeleteDocumentRequest().withDocumentId(documentId));
} catch (ProhibitedStateException e) {
   // Handle the exception appropriately
   // Show an error message to the user or take necessary actions
}
```

### 2. Preventing Duplicate Document Creation

Consider a situation where you try to create a new document with the same name as an existing one within the same folder. In this case, the ProhibitedStateException will be thrown to indicate that the creation of a duplicate document is prohibited.

To handle this scenario, you can catch the exception and display a user-friendly message:

```java
try {
   workDocsClient.createDocument(new CreateDocumentRequest().withParentFolderId(folderId).withName(documentName));
} catch (ProhibitedStateException e) {
   // Handle the exception appropriately
   // Show an error message indicating that the document already exists
}
```

## Key Methods

To provide developers with effective control over the ProhibitedStateException, the AWS WorkDocs SDK defines a set of key methods. These methods allow you to perform specific actions based on the current state of the resource.

Here are some essential methods related to the ProhibitedStateException:

- `public void deleteDocument(DeleteDocumentRequest request)`: Attempts to delete the specified document. If the document is locked for editing or in any other restricted state, a ProhibitedStateException is thrown.

- `public DocumentMetadata getDocument(GetDocumentRequest request)`: Retrieves the metadata of the specified document. If the document is in a prohibited state or cannot be accessed, a ProhibitedStateException is thrown.

- `public DocumentMetadata updateDocumentVersion(UpdateDocumentVersionRequest request)`: Updates the specified document version. If the document is locked, flagged as retired, or in any other restricted state, a ProhibitedStateException is thrown.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the ProhibitedStateException serves as a vital guardrail within the AWS WorkDocs ecosystem. By throwing this exception, the AWS WorkDocs SDK enables developers to handle specific scenarios where an operation is prohibited due to the current state of a resource. Understanding how to handle this exception empowers developers to build more robust and user-friendly applications.

To explore more about the ProhibitedStateException and other exception classes provided by the AWS WorkDocs SDK, refer to the official AWS documentation:

- [AWS WorkDocs API documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/api/Welcome.html)

Now that you have a better understanding of the ProhibitedStateException, you can leverage this knowledge to enhance the reliability and responsiveness of your AWS WorkDocs integrated applications.

Happy coding!
