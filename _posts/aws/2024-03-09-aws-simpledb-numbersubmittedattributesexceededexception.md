Have you ever encountered the frustrating situation where you're trying to work with AWS Simple DB and receive the `NumberSubmittedAttributesExceededException`? This exception is thrown when the number of attributes being submitted during a `PutAttributes` or `BatchPutAttributes` operation exceeds the allowed limit. In this article, we will delve into the details of this exception, explore its causes, and discuss strategies to handle it effectively.

## Understanding the `NumberSubmittedAttributesExceededException`

The `NumberSubmittedAttributesExceededException` is a specific exception thrown by the `com.amazonaws.services.simpledb.model` package when the maximum number of attributes allowed in a single `PutAttributes` or `BatchPutAttributes` operation is exceeded. AWS Simple DB imposes certain limitations to enhance system performance and maintain efficiency.

Before we delve deeper into this exception, let's have a look at the relevant Java class declaration:

```java
public class NumberSubmittedAttributesExceededException extends
    AmazonSimpleDBException implements Serializable {
    // Exception details
}
```
Here, the exception extends the `AmazonSimpleDBException` class, which is a superclass providing the base structure for exceptions in AWS Simple DB.

## What Causes the Exception to be Thrown?

The `NumberSubmittedAttributesExceededException` is thrown when the sum of attribute name-value pairs exceeds the permitted limit. AWS Simple DB sets the maximum number of attribute name-value pairs that can be submitted in a single operation to 256. If your data requires more attributes, you will need to split them across multiple operations.

When making a `PutAttributes` call, each attribute name and value pair counts as one submission. For example, if you are submitting 100 attributes with attribute names `attr1` to `attr100`, it will be considered as 100 separate submissions.

The same rule applies to `BatchPutAttributes`. Each attribute name-value pair counts as one submission, irrespective of the number of items being submitted.

## Handling the Exception Gracefully

When confronted with the `NumberSubmittedAttributesExceededException`, it is important to handle the exception gracefully to ensure your application's smooth functioning. Here are a few strategies you can adopt to manage this exception:

### 1. Check the Number of Attribute Submissions

Before submitting the attributes, ensure that the count of attribute name-value pairs to be submitted is within the permitted limit (256). You can use the `PutRequest` or `ReplaceableItem` object to construct the attributes. Here is an example snippet:

```java
PutRequest putRequest = new PutRequest()
    .withItemName("item1")
    .withAttributes(
        new ReplaceableAttribute("attr1", "value1", true),
        new ReplaceableAttribute("attr2", "value2", true),
        // Add more ReplaceableAttributes
    );
```

### 2. Split Large Submissions into Multiple Operations

If your data exceeds the permissible limit, you can split the submissions into multiple `PutAttributes` or `BatchPutAttributes` operations. You can use a loop or iterate through your data to construct separate submissions. Here's an example that implements this strategy:

```java
final int maxAttributesPerBatch = 100;

for (int i = 0; i < totalAttributes; i += maxAttributesPerBatch) {
    List<ReplaceableAttribute> attributes = new ArrayList<>();
    
    for (int j = i; j < Math.min(i + maxAttributesPerBatch, totalAttributes); j++) {
        attributes.add(new ReplaceableAttribute("attr" + j, "value" + j, true));
    }
    
    // Make your PutAttributes or BatchPutAttributes call using the constructed attributes list
}
```

By splitting large submissions, you ensure that the number of attribute submissions remains within the permissible limit.

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored the `NumberSubmittedAttributesExceededException` in AWS Simple DB and discussed its causes and ways to handle it. It is crucial to be aware of the limitations set by AWS Simple DB to avoid running into this exception. By carefully managing the number of attribute submissions and splitting large submissions into multiple operations, you can sidestep this exception and maintain smooth application functionality.
