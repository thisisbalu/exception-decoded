When working with AWS CodeCommit, developers often encounter various exceptions that need to be handled effectively. One such exception is the `InvalidFileModeException` of the `com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.model` package. This article dives deep into this exception, explains its causes, and offers practical examples for proper exception handling. So, let's begin!

## What is `InvalidFileModeException`?
The `InvalidFileModeException` is an exception that occurs in AWS CodeCommit when an invalid file mode is specified while performing an operation on a file. It is part of the `com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.model` package, which provides a set of classes for interacting with CodeCommit.

## Causes of `InvalidFileModeException`
The `InvalidFileModeException` is generally thrown when attempting to perform operations that require a valid file mode, such as creating or modifying a file. This exception occurs due to the following reasons:
1. **Invalid file mode value:** If you provide an invalid file mode value, such as an unsupported permission or an incorrect permission type, the `InvalidFileModeException` will be triggered.
2. **Missing or null file mode:** If the file mode is missing or set to null while performing an operation, the exception will be raised.

## Handling `InvalidFileModeException`
To handle the `InvalidFileModeException` effectively, consider the following practices:
1. **Validate file mode value:** Before performing any operation that requires a file mode, validate the provided file mode value against the supported modes defined by AWS CodeCommit. You can refer to the AWS CodeCommit documentation [link here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/APIReference/welcome.html) for the list of supported file modes.
2. **Catch and log the exception:** Surround the code block that may throw the `InvalidFileModeException` with a try-catch block. Catch the exception, log the relevant error message along with any additional information that can assist in troubleshooting, and take appropriate actions based on your application's requirements.
3. **Inform the user:** If your application allows user input for file mode selection, provide clear instructions and error messages when an invalid file mode is provided. Display user-friendly error messages that help users understand the acceptable file modes or suggest alternative actions.

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Listing all files in a repository
In this example, we demonstrate how to use the `ListFiles` operation to retrieve a list of all files in a repository, handling any potential `InvalidFileModeException`.

```java
try {
    // Create a AWS CodeCommit client
    CodeCommitClient codeCommitClient = CodeCommitClient.builder().build();

    // Perform ListFiles operation with invalid file mode
    ListFilesRequest listFilesRequest = new ListFilesRequest()
                                            .withRepositoryName("my-repo")
                                            .withInvalidFileMode("invalid-mode");
    ListFilesResult listFilesResult = codeCommitClient.listFiles(listFilesRequest);

    // Process the list of files
    List<File> files = listFilesResult.getFiles();
    // ... process the files as required
} catch (InvalidFileModeException e) {
    // Log the error and inform the user about the invalid file mode
    logger.error("InvalidFileModeException occurred: {}", e.getMessage());
    logger.error("Please provide a valid file mode for the operation.");
    // ... additional error handling code
}
```

### Example 2: Modifying file permissions
In this example, we show how to modify file permissions using the `PutFile` operation, handling the `InvalidFileModeException` appropriately.

```java
try {
    // Create a AWS CodeCommit client
    CodeCommitClient codeCommitClient = CodeCommitClient.builder().build();

    // Update file permissions
    PutFileRequest putFileRequest = new PutFileRequest()
                                        .withRepositoryName("my-repo")
                                        .withFilePath("path/to/file.txt")
                                        .withFileContent(ByteBuffer.wrap("Updated content".getBytes()))
                                        .withFileMode(FileMode.EXECUTABLE); // Provide a valid file mode
    PutFileResult putFileResult = codeCommitClient.putFile(putFileRequest);

    // Process the putFile result
    // ... additional code handling putFile response
} catch (InvalidFileModeException e) {
    // Log the error and inform the user about the invalid file mode
    logger.error("InvalidFileModeException occurred: {}", e.getMessage());
    logger.error("Please provide a valid file mode for modifying file permissions.");
    // ... additional error handling code
}
```

## Conclusion
The `InvalidFileModeException` plays a crucial role in handling invalid file mode values when working with AWS CodeCommit. By following best practices, such as validating file mode values, properly catching and logging exceptions, and informing users about invalid inputs, you can effectively handle and prevent this exception. Remember to refer to the official AWS CodeCommit documentation for a comprehensive understanding of valid file mode options and other related concepts.
