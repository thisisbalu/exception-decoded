## Introduction

Are you using AWS Organizations to manage multiple AWS accounts and permissions within your organization? If so, you may have come across the `FinalizingOrganizationException` in the `com.amazonaws.services.organizations.model` package. In this article, we'll explore this exception in detail, its causes, and best practices for handling it effectively. So, let's dive in!

## What is the FinalizingOrganizationException?

The `FinalizingOrganizationException` is a specific exception class in the `com.amazonaws.services.organizations.model` package, designed to handle errors related to the finalization process of an organization within AWS Organizations. When this exception is thrown, it signifies that there are pending changes or tasks that need to be completed before the organization can be finalized.

### Key Points to Note:
- Throws: `com.amazonaws.services.organizations.model.FinalizingOrganizationException`
- Available since: SDK Version 1.11.689
- Inherits from: `AWSOrganizationsException`

## Causes of FinalizingOrganizationException

When attempting to finalize an organization in AWS Organizations, the following scenarios may cause the `FinalizingOrganizationException` to be thrown:

1. **Pending Changes**: If there are any pending changes within the organization, such as creating or deleting accounts, moving accounts between root or organizational units, or updating policies, the organization cannot be finalized until these changes are resolved.

2. **Pending Tasks**: AWS Organizations performs various tasks in the background, such as sending email invitations for new accounts or initiating policy updates. If there are pending tasks associated with the organization, it cannot be finalized until these tasks are completed.

## Best Practices for Handling FinalizingOrganizationException

Handling the `FinalizingOrganizationException` effectively is crucial to ensure a smooth organization finalization process. Here are some best practices to follow when encountering this exception:

### 1. Check Pending Changes and Tasks

The first step in handling the `FinalizingOrganizationException` is to identify any pending changes or tasks associated with the organization. You can use the following code snippet as a reference:

```java
try {
    // Finalize the organization
    organizationsClient.finalizeOrganization(new FinalizeOrganizationRequest());
} catch (FinalizingOrganizationException e) {
    // Check if there are any pending changes or tasks
    if (e.getReason().equals("PENDING_CHANGES")) {
        // Handle pending changes
        // ...
    } else if (e.getReason().equals("PENDING_TASKS")) {
        // Handle pending tasks
        // ...
    }
}
```

The `getReason()` method returns a string indicating the reason for the exception (`PENDING_CHANGES` or `PENDING_TASKS`). Based on the reason, you can implement the necessary logic to handle the pending changes or tasks appropriately.

### 2. Dealing with Pending Changes

If the exception indicates pending changes as the reason, you must resolve them before attempting to finalize the organization. Here are a few examples of how to handle pending changes:

```java
if (e.getReason().equals("PENDING_CHANGES")) {
    List<CreateAccountStatus> createAccountStatusList = e.getCreateAccountStatus();

    // Iterate through the createAccountStatusList and take appropriate actions
    for (CreateAccountStatus status : createAccountStatusList) {
        if (status.getState().equals("FAILED")) {
            // Handle failed account creation
            // ...
        } else if (status.getState().equals("SUCCEEDED")) {
            // Handle successful account creation
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

The `getCreateAccountStatus()` method returns a list of `CreateAccountStatus` objects that contain information about the pending account changes. You can iterate through this list and perform actions based on the state of each account change.

### 3. Handling Pending Tasks

If the exception indicates pending tasks as the reason, you need to wait for these tasks to complete before finalizing the organization. Here's an example of how to handle the pending tasks:

```java
if (e.getReason().equals("PENDING_TASKS")) {
    List<Task> pendingTasks = e.getPendingTasks();
    
    // Iterate through the pendingTasks and wait for them to complete
    for (Task task : pendingTasks) {
        waitForTaskCompletion(task.getTaskId());
    }
}
```

The `getPendingTasks()` method returns a list of `Task` objects that represent the pending tasks associated with the organization. You can iterate through this list and implement your own logic to wait for each task to complete. The `taskId` can be used to track the progress of each task.
