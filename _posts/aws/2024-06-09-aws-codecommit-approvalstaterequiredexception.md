## 1. What is AWS CodeCommit?

AWS CodeCommit is a managed source control service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It offers a scalable and fully-managed Git-based repository for hosting and managing secure and reliable code. CodeCommit provides features like collaboration, version control, pull requests, and more, making it an essential tool for software development teams.

## 2. Understanding ApprovalStateRequiredException

The `ApprovalStateRequiredException` is an exception class in the `com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.model` package of the AWS CodeCommit SDK. When this exception is thrown, it indicates that an action performed on a pull request requires an approval state that is missing or invalid. In simpler terms, it means that the requested action cannot be performed until the pull request undergoes the required approvals.

## 3. Common Scenarios for ApprovalStateRequiredException

Let's look at some common scenarios where the `ApprovalStateRequiredException` might arise:

**1. Invalid Merge Attempt**

Attempting to merge a pull request without the necessary approvals is a common scenario where the exception occurs. Merge operations require an approved pull request before they can be executed.

**2. Missing Approval Workflow**

If your repository has a configured approval workflow, all pull requests must follow this workflow before they can be merged. If a pull request does not have the necessary approvals based on the defined workflow, the exception will be thrown.

**3. Unapproved Pull Requests**

In cases where a pull request is created but not yet approved, any actions requiring the pull request to be in an approved state will result in the `ApprovalStateRequiredException`.

## 4. How to Handle ApprovalStateRequiredException?

To handle the `ApprovalStateRequiredException`, you need to ensure that the pull request has the necessary approvals before performing the desired action. Here's an example of handling the exception with the `try-catch` block in Java:

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.AWSCodeCommit;
import com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.model.ApprovalStateRequiredException;
import com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.model.MergePullRequestByFastForwardRequest;

AWSCodeCommit codeCommitClient = AWSCodeCommitClientBuilder.defaultClient();

try {
    MergePullRequestByFastForwardRequest mergeRequest = new MergePullRequestByFastForwardRequest()
            .withPullRequestId("your_pull_request_id")
            .withRepositoryName("your_repository_name");

    codeCommitClient.mergePullRequestByFastForward(mergeRequest);
} catch (ApprovalStateRequiredException e) {
    System.out.println("The pull request requires approval before merging.");
    // Handle the exception logic here
}
```

In the above example, we catch the `ApprovalStateRequiredException` and provide custom logic to handle the scenario appropriately. You can customize the logic based on your specific requirements.

## 5. Best Practices for Avoiding ApprovalStateRequiredException

While handling the `ApprovalStateRequiredException` is important, it is always beneficial to avoid the exception altogether. Here are some best practices to follow:

1. **Implement an Approval Workflow**: Define an approval workflow for your repository to ensure all pull requests go through the necessary approvals before merging.

2. **Enforce Checks**: Configure your repository settings to require a minimum number of approvals and enforce branch protections. This helps maintain code quality and ensures the necessary reviews are in place.

3. **Educate Team Members**: Educate your team members about the workflows and approval processes in place. Encourage them to proactively seek approvals to prevent unnecessary exceptions.

## 6. Conclusion

In this article, we explored the `ApprovalStateRequiredException` class in the `com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.model` package of AWS CodeCommit. We discussed its purpose, common scenarios where it may occur, and how to handle it using examples. Additionally, we provided some best practices to prevent encountering this exception in your CodeCommit workflow.

By understanding and effectively handling the `ApprovalStateRequiredException`, you will ensure a smoother and more controlled workflow within your AWS CodeCommit repositories.
