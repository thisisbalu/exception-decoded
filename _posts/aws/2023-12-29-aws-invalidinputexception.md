**Introduction**

AWS Migration Hub is a powerful service that allows users to monitor the progress of application migration across multiple AWS services. It provides a centralized view of all application migrations, making it easier for users to track and manage their migration projects. However, like any other service, AWS Migration Hub is not exempt from errors. One such error that users may encounter is the `InvalidInputException`.

In this article, we will dive deep into the `InvalidInputException` of the `com.amazonaws.services.migrationhub.model` package in AWS Migration Hub. We will explore what this exception indicates, how to handle it, and provide code examples to better understand its usage.

## Understanding the `InvalidInputException`

The `InvalidInputException` is an exception class that extends the `AmazonMigrationHubException` class, which is the base class for all exceptions thrown by the AWS Migration Hub service.

As the name suggests, the `InvalidInputException` is thrown when an input parameter provided to an API call is deemed invalid. This can happen due to several reasons, such as missing mandatory fields, incorrect field values, or improper formatting.

When this exception is thrown, it indicates that the input provided does not meet the requirements set by the AWS Migration Hub service. It is important to note that this exception is specific to errors related to invalid input and should not be confused with other exceptions.

## Handling `InvalidInputException`

Now that we know what the `InvalidInputException` indicates, let's explore how to handle it in our code. To effectively handle this exception, we need to follow a few practices that ensure graceful error handling and smooth execution of our code.

### 1. Catch the `InvalidInputException`

To handle the `InvalidInputException`, we need to catch it using a `try-catch` block. By catching the exception, we can gracefully handle the error and take appropriate action.

Consider the following example where we call the `getClientInputInfo` method, which is prone to throwing the `InvalidInputException`:

```java
try {
    ClientInputInfo inputInfo = migrationHubClient.getClientInputInfo();
    // Handle the valid input
} catch (InvalidInputException e) {
    // Handle the invalid input error
    System.out.println("Invalid input error: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

In the example above, we catch the `InvalidInputException` and print the error message to the console. However, you can customize the exception handling based on your application's requirements.

### 2. Validate Input Parameters

To avoid the `InvalidInputException` altogether, it is good practice to validate the input parameters before making an API call. This ensures that the parameters meet the required conditions and comply with the AWS Migration Hub service's expectations.

Consider the following code snippet where we validate the `migrationTaskName` parameter before making the API call:

```java
public void startMigrationTask(String migrationTaskName) {
    if (migrationTaskName == null || migrationTaskName.isEmpty()) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Migration task name cannot be empty");
    }

    // Make the API call with valid input parameters
    migrationHubClient.startMigrationTask(migrationTaskName);
}
```

In the example above, we explicitly check if the `migrationTaskName` is null or empty and throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if it fails the validation. This approach ensures that we avoid making API calls with invalid input parameters.

### 3. Follow AWS Migration Hub API Documentation

AWS provides comprehensive documentation for the Migration Hub service, including details about valid input parameters and their specific requirements. It is essential to thoroughly read and understand the API documentation to avoid potential pitfalls and ensure proper input validation.

By following the API documentation, you can ensure that your input parameters adhere to the required format, character limits, and any other constraints set by the service.

## Conclusion

In this article, we discussed the `InvalidInputException` in the `com.amazonaws.services.migrationhub.model` package of AWS Migration Hub. We explored what this exception indicates and how to handle it effectively.

To handle the `InvalidInputException` gracefully, we rely on techniques such as catching the exception using a `try-catch` block, validating input parameters, and following the AWS Migration Hub API documentation.

By implementing these practices, you can ensure that your AWS Migration Hub integration remains robust, efficient, and error-free.
