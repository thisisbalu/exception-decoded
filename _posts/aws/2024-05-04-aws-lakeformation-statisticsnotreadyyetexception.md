## Introduction

In the world of data lakes, AWS Lake Formation is a powerful service that helps users build and manage a secure, scalable data lake in the cloud. With Lake Formation, you can easily ingest, store, catalog, and analyze your data using AWS services like Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon Athena.

However, as with any complex system, you may encounter various exceptions when working with Lake Formation. One such exception is the StatisticsNotReadyYetException, which can occur when trying to access or query data within a data lake.

In this article, we will explore what the StatisticsNotReadyYetException is, what causes it, and how you can handle it effectively in your AWS Lake Formation applications.

## Understanding the StatisticsNotReadyYetException

### What is the StatisticsNotReadyYetException?

The `StatisticsNotReadyYetException` is an exception class defined in the `com.amazonaws.services.lakeformation.model` package of the AWS SDK for Java. It indicates that the statistics required to perform a specific operation on a table or partition within a data lake are not yet available.

### When does the StatisticsNotReadyYetException occur?

The `StatisticsNotReadyYetException` can occur in various scenarios, but it is commonly encountered when working with query operations on data stored in a data lake. For example, when executing a query using Amazon Athena, the exception may be thrown if the statistics required to optimize the query have not been computed yet.

In most cases, statistical metadata is automatically collected and updated by AWS Lake Formation in the background. However, there might be situations where the required statistics are not ready at the time of the query execution, resulting in the exception being thrown.

### How to handle the StatisticsNotReadyYetException?

When you encounter the `StatisticsNotReadyYetException`, it's important to handle it gracefully to ensure a smooth user experience. Here are a few strategies for handling this exception effectively:

#### 1. Retry the operation

One approach is to implement a retry mechanism that retries the operation after a certain delay. This delay allows time for the statistics to be recalculated and become available. You can use exponential backoff algorithms to gradually increase the delay between retry attempts. Here's an example of how to implement a retry mechanism in Java:

```java
try {
    // Perform the operation that may throw StatisticsNotReadyYetException
    // ...
} catch (StatisticsNotReadyYetException ex) {
    // Retry the operation after a delay
    int maxRetries = 5;
    int retryDelayMs = 1000;
    int retryCount = 0;
    
    while(retryCount < maxRetries) {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(retryDelayMs);
            
            // Retry the operation
            // ...
            
            break; // Exit the loop if the operation succeeds
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            // Handle the exception or log it for debugging purposes
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        
        retryDelayMs *= 2; // Increase the delay exponentially
        retryCount++;
    }
}
```

#### 2. Inform the user or application

In some cases, it may be appropriate to inform the user or upstream applications that the statistics are not yet ready and suggest waiting or trying again later. This can help manage expectations and provide a better user experience.

For example, if you're developing a web application, you can display a friendly message indicating that the requested data is temporarily unavailable due to ongoing statistical computations. You can also provide an estimated time or progress indicator to give users an idea of when they can expect the data to become available.

#### 3. Check the statistics manually

Another option is to manually check the availability of statistics before executing an operation. You can use the `GetTableStatistics()` or `GetPartitionStatistics()` API methods provided by AWS Lake Formation to retrieve the statistics metadata for a table or partition. By checking the last analyzed time or the completeness of statistics, you can determine if the required statistics are ready for use.

Here's an example of how to use the `GetTableStatistics()` method in Java:

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.lakeformation.AWSPartitions.GetTableStatistics;
import com.amazonaws.services.lakeformation.AWSPartitions.GetTableStatisticsRequest;
import com.amazonaws.services.lakeformation.AWSPartitions.GetTableStatisticsResult;

// Create a client for AWS Lake Formation
AWSPartitions client = AWSPartitionsClientBuilder.defaultClient();

// Create the request to get table statistics
GetTableStatisticsRequest request = new GetTableStatisticsRequest()
    .withDatabaseName("my_database")
    .withTableName("my_table");

// Execute the request and retrieve the statistics result
GetTableStatisticsResult result = client.getTableStatistics(request);

// Check if the last analyzed time is recent
Date lastAnalyzed = result.getTableStatistics().getLastAnalyzedTime();
if (lastAnalyzed != null && lastAnalyzed.after(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() - TimeUnit.HOURS.toMillis(24)))) {
    // The statistics are ready, proceed with the operation
    // ...
} else {
    // The statistics are not ready yet, handle accordingly
    // ...
}
```

## Conclusion

The StatisticsNotReadyYetException is a common exception encountered when working with AWS Lake Formation and querying data from a data lake. It indicates that the required statistics for a specific operation are not yet available. By understanding this exception and implementing appropriate handling strategies, you can ensure a smooth and reliable data lake experience for your users.

Remember to use retry mechanisms, inform users or applications about the status of statistics, and utilize the available AWS Lake Formation API methods to check the readiness of statistics before executing critical operations.

Now that you have a better understanding of the StatisticsNotReadyYetException, you can take advantage of these techniques to build robust and resilient data lake applications with AWS Lake Formation.
