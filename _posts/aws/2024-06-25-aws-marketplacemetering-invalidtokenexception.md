## 1. What is AWS Marketplace Metering?
AWS Marketplace Metering is a service offered by Amazon Web Services that enables software sellers to meter the usage of their software products running on AWS. With this service, sellers can track usage data and monetize their products based on metered usage. AWS Marketplace Metering provides APIs that allow sellers to integrate usage tracking into their products and collect relevant data.

## 2. Understanding InvalidTokenException
The **InvalidTokenException** is a specific exception that can be encountered when working with the `com.amazonaws.services.marketplacemetering.model` package in AWS Marketplace Metering. This exception is thrown for one main reason: when an invalid token is provided.

In AWS Marketplace Metering, tokens are used to authenticate requests to various API operations. These tokens include the AWS access key ID, secret access key, and session token. If any of these tokens are incorrect, expired, or in an improper format, the `InvalidTokenException` will be thrown.

The `InvalidTokenException` class is a subclass of the `AWSMarketplaceMeteringException` class, which itself extends the `AmazonServiceException`. This means that when handling this exception, you can catch it like any other `AWSMarketplaceMeteringException` and handle it accordingly.

## 3. How to Handle InvalidTokenException
To handle the `InvalidTokenException` effectively, you should follow these best practices:

- **Check token expiration**: Before making any API requests, make sure to check the expiration time of your access tokens. If a token has expired, you will need to renew it before making a request. You can use AWS SDKs or IAM (Identity and Access Management) to generate new tokens.

- **Validate token format**: Ensure that all tokens provided follow the correct format. For example, AWS access keys follow a 20-character alphanumeric format, whereas session tokens have a specific structure. Validate the format of your tokens before making API requests.

- **Catch and handle the exception**: When making requests to AWS Marketplace Metering APIs, always enclose your code in a try-catch block. Catch any `InvalidTokenException` and handle it appropriately. It is important to provide descriptive error messages to users, helping them understand the issue and potentially rectify it.

## 4. Code Examples
Let's explore some code examples to better understand how to handle the `InvalidTokenException`. We will assume that you are using the AWS Java SDK for these examples.

**Example 1: Handling InvalidTokenException**
```java
import com.amazonaws.AmazonServiceException;
import com.amazonaws.services.marketplacemetering.AWSMarketplaceMeteringClient;
import com.amazonaws.services.marketplacemetering.model.InvalidTokenException;

AWSMarketplaceMeteringClient client = new AWSMarketplaceMeteringClient();

try {
    // Perform AWS Marketplace Metering API operations requiring authentication
} catch (InvalidTokenException e) {
    System.err.println("Invalid token provided. Please check your access credentials.");
} catch (AmazonServiceException e) {
    System.err.println("An error occurred while processing the request: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

**Example 2: Token Expiration Check**
```java
import com.amazonaws.SDKGlobalConfiguration;
import com.amazonaws.auth.AWSCredentialsProvider;
import com.amazonaws.auth.AWSStaticCredentialsProvider;
import com.amazonaws.auth.BasicAWSCredentials;
import com.amazonaws.services.marketplacemetering.AWSMarketplaceMeteringClient;
import com.amazonaws.services.marketplacemetering.model.InvalidTokenException;

// Set up credentials and client
String accessKey = "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY";
String secretKey = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY";
String sessionToken = "YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN";

AWSCredentialsProvider credentialsProvider = new AWSStaticCredentialsProvider(
    new BasicAWSCredentials(accessKey, secretKey)
);
System.setProperty(SDKGlobalConfiguration.ACCESS_KEY_SYSTEM_PROPERTY, accessKey);
System.setProperty(SDKGlobalConfiguration.SECRET_KEY_SYSTEM_PROPERTY, secretKey);
System.setProperty(SDKGlobalConfiguration.AWS_SESSION_TOKEN_SYSTEM_PROPERTY, sessionToken);

try {
    // Check token expiration before making a request
    if (credentialsProvider.getCredentials().getExpiration().before(new Date())) {
        System.out.println("Token has expired. Renewing token...");
        // Call your code to renew tokens and update credentialsProvider
        // credentialsProvider.refresh();
    } else {
        AWSMarketplaceMeteringClient client = new AWSMarketplaceMeteringClient(credentialsProvider);

        // Perform AWS Marketplace Metering API operations requiring authentication
    }
} catch (InvalidTokenException e) {
    System.err.println("Invalid token provided. Please check your access credentials.");
} catch (AmazonServiceException e) {
    System.err.println("An error occurred while processing the request: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

## Conclusion
In this article, we explored the InvalidTokenException in AWS Marketplace Metering. We discussed its meaning, causes, and best practices for handling this exception effectively.

Remember to always verify the expiration and format of your access tokens before making any requests. Catch the InvalidTokenException and provide helpful error messages to assist the user in resolving any access token issues.
