When working with AWS CodePipeline, developers often encounter various exceptions that can derail their continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows. One such exception is the `InvalidNextTokenException`, which can leave users scratching their heads. In this article, we’ll dive deep into what the `InvalidNextTokenException` is, explore its causes, provide actionable code examples, and offer best practices to avoid running into this issue. 

## What is InvalidNextTokenException?

The `InvalidNextTokenException` is an exception that occurs in AWS CodePipeline when the pagination token provided to a list operation is invalid. AWS uses pagination tokens to manage large sets of data, and CodePipeline utilizes this mechanism when listing things like pipeline executions, changes, or artifacts. If the token you send with your request is out of sync or has expired, you will face this specific exception.

### Common Scenarios Leading to InvalidNextTokenException

1. **Expired Token**: Pagination tokens may expire if a significant amount of time elapses between handling requests.
2. **Token Mishandling**: Sending an incorrect or previously used token that no longer corresponds to any existing data can also trigger this exception.
3. **Multiple Concurrent Calls**: If your application makes concurrent calls to list operations without managing state correctly, it may lead to passing an outdated token.

## Example of InvalidNextTokenException

Let’s explore a code example that demonstrates how this exception can be encountered. Consider the following Java code snippet that uses the AWS SDK for Java to list pipeline executions in AWS CodePipeline.

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.codepipeline.AWSCodePipeline;
import com.amazonaws.services.codepipeline.AWSCodePipelineClientBuilder;
import com.amazonaws.services.codepipeline.model.ListPipelineExecutionsRequest;
import com.amazonaws.services.codepipeline.model.ListPipelineExecutionsResult;

public class CodePipelineExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        AWSCodePipeline codePipeline = AWSCodePipelineClientBuilder.defaultClient();
        String pipelineName = "YourPipelineName";
        String nextToken = null;

        try {
            do {
                ListPipelineExecutionsRequest request = new ListPipelineExecutionsRequest()
                        .withPipelineName(pipelineName)
                        .withNextToken(nextToken);
                
                ListPipelineExecutionsResult result = codePipeline.listPipelineExecutions(request);
                // Process the result
                result.getPipelineExecutionSummaries().forEach(summary -> {
                    System.out.println("Execution ID: " + summary.getPipelineExecutionId());
                });
                
                nextToken = result.getNextToken(); // Get next token for pagination
            } while (nextToken != null);
        } catch (com.amazonaws.services.codepipeline.model.InvalidNextTokenException e) {
            // Handle the exception
            System.err.println("Invalid Next Token: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, if `nextToken` becomes invalid at any point during execution, the program will catch the `InvalidNextTokenException`, and the error message will be printed.

## Identifying Causes of InvalidNextTokenException

To troubleshoot the `InvalidNextTokenException`, here are some steps you can take:

1. **Log Tokens**: Log the `nextToken` in your application to see which token is causing the issue.
2. **Check Timing of Requests**: Ensure that the fetches for pagination are occurring in quick succession without long delays that could invalidate the tokens.
3. **Synchronous Operations**: Consider making list requests synchronously if you are running them concurrently.

### Best Practices to Avoid InvalidNextTokenException

1. **Handle Tokens Carefully**: Always ensure that tokens are only used immediately after retrieving them. Avoid saving them for long periods.
2. **Implement Retry Logic**: Wrap calls in retry blocks to handle transient errors, including pagination-related issues. You can implement an exponential back-off strategy to manage retries.
3. **Check for Null Tokens**: Always check for null tokens after making a request and break your loop if no further tokens are returned.

### Code Example with Retry Logic

Here’s an example implementing a simple retry logic for listing pipeline executions:

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.codepipeline.AWSCodePipeline;
import com.amazonaws.services.codepipeline.AWSCodePipelineClientBuilder;
import com.amazonaws.services.codepipeline.model.ListPipelineExecutionsRequest;
import com.amazonaws.services.codepipeline.model.ListPipelineExecutionsResult;

public class CodePipelineExampleWithRetry {
    private static final int MAX_RETRIES = 3;

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        AWSCodePipeline codePipeline = AWSCodePipelineClientBuilder.defaultClient();
        String pipelineName = "YourPipelineName";
        String nextToken = null;

        int attempts = 0;

        while (attempts < MAX_RETRIES) {
            try {
                ListPipelineExecutionsRequest request = new ListPipelineExecutionsRequest()
                        .withPipelineName(pipelineName)
                        .withNextToken(nextToken);
                
                ListPipelineExecutionsResult result = codePipeline.listPipelineExecutions(request);
                
                result.getPipelineExecutionSummaries().forEach(summary -> {
                    System.out.println("Execution ID: " + summary.getPipelineExecutionId());
                });

                nextToken = result.getNextToken();
                if (nextToken == null) break; // Exit if no more tokens                
                attempts = 0; // Reset attempts on success
                
            } catch (com.amazonaws.services.codepipeline.model.InvalidNextTokenException e) {
                System.err.println("Invalid Next Token: " + e.getMessage());
                attempts++;
                // Optionally add a sleep here before retrying
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Dealing with the `InvalidNextTokenException` in AWS CodePipeline can be frustrating, especially when it disrupts your CI/CD processes. By understanding this exception, identifying potential causes, and adhering to best practices, you can mitigate these issues effectively. Implementing rigorous error handling, careful token management, and retry logic can save time and improve your application’s robustness.
