## Introduction

Stumbling upon SSL/TLS certificate problems when working with secure Java applications? Been through the wringer with `CertificateNotYetValidException` in Java? It's critical to secure applications using SSL/TLS certificates, but dealing with the exceptions that come along with certificates can be a hurdle, especially when you're not acquainted with them. This article aims at unfolding `CertificateNotYetValidException` in its entirety.

## Diving into CertificateNotYetValidException 

`CertificateNotYetValidException` is a subtype of `CertificateException`, extensively used in Java programming. It is thrown when a certificate is accessed before its valid period. This exception takes into account the system's current date and time and compares it with the `NotBefore` date stipulated in the certificate.

Here's an example of what this exception might look like:

```java
import java.security.cert.CertificateNotYetValidException;
import java.security.cert.X509Certificate;
import java.util.Date;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      // Assuming someCertificate is an X509Certificate
      X509Certificate someCertificate = generateCertificate();
      someCertificate.checkValidity(new Date());
    } catch (CertificateNotYetValidException e) {
      System.out.println("Certificate is not yet valid");
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}
```
Above, the `checkValidity()` method throws `CertificateNotYetValidException` if the current date is before the `NotBefore` date.

## Understanding the Causes of  CertificateNotYetValidException 

`CertificateNotYetValidException` pops up due to few notable reasons:

1. **Unaligned Certificate date:** If the `NotBefore` date of the certificate is future-dated, relative to the system clock.

2. **Out-of-sync System clock:** The system clock is not correctly synchronized or configured.

3. **Invalid Certificate:** When attempting to use a certificate not yet applicable. This is common in testing or development environments.

## Bug Fixes for CertificateNotYetValidException

Resolving the `CertificateNotYetValidException` requires understanding of the root cause:

1. **Synchronize your System Clock:** Make sure your system's date and time aligns with global timing. Using NTP (Network Time Protocol) can be a solution for automatic system clock synchronization.

2. **Verify your Certificate:** A cursory check on the `NotBefore` and `NotAfter` dates of the certificate should be in order.

3. **Production Environments:** Make sure to use valid certificates in production. Use of future-dated certificates in your production applications should be avoided.

```java
import java.security.cert.*;
import javax.security.cert.CertificateExpiredException;
import java.util.Date;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      // Assuming someCertificate is an X509Certificate
      X509Certificate someCertificate = generateCertificate();
      Date date = new Date();
      if (date.before(someCertificate.getNotBefore()) || date.after(someCertificate.getNotAfter())) {
        throw new CertificateException("Certificate is not within valid period.");
      }
    } catch (CertificateException e) {
      System.out.println(e.getMessage());
    }
  }
}
```
In the code above, we validated the certificate by comparing the current date with the `NotBefore` and `NotAfter` dates of the certificate.

## Wrapping Up: Towards an Error-Free Certificate Journey in Java

Working with SSL/TLS certificates in Java can pose some hurdles, particularly understanding and handling possible exceptions. However, knowing how `CertificateNotYetValidException` works will prevent errors when dealing with certificates. Armed with the strategies and approaches outlined in this post, you can effectively troubleshoot these issues.
