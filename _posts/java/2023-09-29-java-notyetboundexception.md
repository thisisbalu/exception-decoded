Hello Java developers and enthusiasts, today we are tackling a topic that many Java developers encounter, especially those who are working in the area of networking with the Java NIO (New Input/Output) package.

In this post, we'll focus on understanding and handling the NotYetBoundException in Java. We will look at what this exception is, when it occurs, and how to properly handle it to avoid application crashes.

## What is NotYetBoundException?

In Java, a `NotYetBoundException` is a type of unchecked exception that is thrown by an instance method of a [SelectableChannel](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/channels/SelectableChannel.html). 

```java
public class NotYetBoundException
extends IllegalStateException
```

It usually happens when you try to use server-side network I/O operations without first properly binding your `ServerSocketChannel` or `DatagramChannel` to a particular address and port.

## When does NotYetBoundException Occur?

Let's look at a simple example of when `NotYetBoundException` might occur. Suppose we are trying to create a simple server side application using the following code snippet:

```java
import java.net.InetSocketAddress;
import java.nio.channels.ServerSocketChannel;
import java.nio.channels.SocketChannel;

public class ServerApp {
    public static void main (String[] args) throws Exception{
        // Create new channel
        ServerSocketChannel serverSocketChannel = ServerSocketChannel.open();

        // Trying to accept connections
        SocketChannel socketChannel = serverSocketChannel.accept();
    }
}
```

In the code snippet above, the `ServerSocketChannel` is opened but no specific address or port is bound to it. So when `accept()` method gets called, which is supposed to accept a connection directed towards this server, it throws an `NotYetBoundException`.

## How to avoid NotYetBoundException?

To avoid `NotYetBoundException`, we need to ensure that the `ServerSocketChannel` is properly bound to a specific address and port before accepting any client requests.

```java
import java.net.InetSocketAddress;
import java.nio.channels.ServerSocketChannel;
import java.nio.channels.SocketChannel;

public class ServerApp {
    public static void main (String[] args) throws Exception{
        // Create new channel
        ServerSocketChannel serverSocketChannel = ServerSocketChannel.open();

        // Bind server socket channel to specific address and port 
        serverSocketChannel.bind(new InetSocketAddress("localhost", 9000));

        // Now, we can safely accept connections
        SocketChannel socketChannel = serverSocketChannel.accept();
    }
}
```

By binding to a specific address and port, we guarantee that our `ServerSocketChannel` is actually set up to receive requests from clients.

## Handling NotYetBoundException?

As with any other exceptions in Java, `NotYetBoundException` can also be handled using a try-catch clause:

```java
try {
    ServerSocketChannel serverSocketChannel = ServerSocketChannel.open();
    SocketChannel socketChannel = serverSocketChannel.accept();
}
catch (NotYetBoundException e) {
    System.out.println("ServerSocketChannel not bound to any address or port.");
}
```

In the code snippet above, if `NotYetBoundException` is thrown it will be caught and a warning message will be displayed.

## Conclusion

In this post, we learned about the `NotYetBoundException` in Java. We looked at what it means, when it is likely to occur, and how to handle it. By understanding how to properly prepare for and handle this exception, we can write more robust, stable, and secure code. Keep practicing, and stay tuned for future tutorials on handling Java exceptions!
