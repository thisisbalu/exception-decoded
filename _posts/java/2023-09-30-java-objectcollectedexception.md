How many times have you been surprised by an `ObjectCollectedException` in Java which you didn't comprehend? Or maybe you've seen it often enough to know it signals a problem youâ€™re not sure how to handle?

Whatever the case, today, we seek to unravel the mystery behind the `ObjectCollectedException` in Java. We aim to present an easy-to-digest, comprehensive guide to this Java creature so you can solve problems related to it swiftly and without second guesses.

## What is ObjectCollectedException?

The `ObjectCollectedException` in Java is an exception provided by the `com.sun.jdi` package of the Java Debug Interface (JDI) [(Reference)](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/jdk.jdi/com/sun/jdi/ObjectCollectedException.html). This exception is thrown to indicate that the desired object has been garbage collected. In other words, it's thrown when a utility method or a correlated function (like invoking a method) is used on an object which is no longer in existence - that object has either been deleted or cleaned up by the garbage collector.

```java
try {
    // Some block of code invoking a utility method or a correlated function.
    someObject.utilityMethod();
} catch (com.sun.jdi.ObjectCollectedException ex) {
    // Handling the exception here
    System.out.println("Oops! Our object has been collected by the garbage collector.");
}
```

## When does ObjectCollectedException occur?

Java's automatic garbage collection system collects and cleans up objects that are no longer in use to free up memory space. When a utility method or a related function is invoked on a collected (deleted) object, this exception can occur. 

Let's consider an example:

```java
try {
    // Creating a variable reference to an object
    MyClass myObject = new MyClass();

    // Now, nullifying the reference, making it a candidate for GC
    myObject = null;

    // Explicit call to GC
    System.gc();

    // Attempting to call method on the object
    myObject.myMethod();
} catch (com.sun.jdi.ObjectCollectedException ex) {
    // Handling exception here
    System.out.println("ObjectCollectedException caught: " + ex.getMessage());
}
```

Here, we instantiate an object of `MyClass` and then nullify the reference. Therefore, the object becomes a candidate for garbage collection, which we explicitly invoked via `System.gc()`. When we try to call a method on the object that has been collected, the JVM will throw the `ObjectCollectedException`.

## Tips for Handling `ObjectCollectedException`

To handle `ObjectCollectedException`, you must ensure that your code doesn't attempt to invoke some methods or functions on objects that might already be cleaned by the garbage collector. You should provide a suitable `null` check for the objects before using them, especially if there's a reasonable chance the object could have been garbage collected.

```java
MyClass myObj = new MyClass();

if(myObj != null){
    myObj.myMethod();
}
else{
    System.out.println("Oops! The object reference is null");
}
```

With the `null` check in place, we can gracefully manage the scenario when the object has been collected.

## Treating `ObjectCollectedException` in Debug Mode 

While debugging, encountering an `ObjectCollectedException` could be an indication that your breakpoints are targeting objects that are not alive they are hit.

To overcome this, keep an eye on the lifespan and the scope of your objects, especially when using conditional breakpoints, watchpoints, or when debugging over recursive methods. 

Consider adjusting your breakpoints or debug configuration to have the referenced object alive until the breakpoint gets hit.

The official API documentation for `ObjectCollectedException` in Java is available here: [(ObjectCollectedException API Doc)](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/jdk.jdi/com/sun/jdi/ObjectCollectedException.html)

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the `ObjectCollectedException` in Java is thrown when we try to use an object that's been collected by the garbage collector. This exception is mostly encountered while debugging. It is essential to ensure the proper lifespan and scope are maintained for objects while writing or debugging the code.

When it comes to managing these exceptions, checking if an object reference is `null` before invoking any operation on it can help in handling such situations efficiently.

We hope this article has equipped you with a better understanding of the `ObjectCollectedException` and provided insights into how you can handle this exception efficiently in your Java applications.
