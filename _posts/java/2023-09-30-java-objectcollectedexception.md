In this blog post, we'll dive deep into a specific topic in the realm of Java programming â€” the ObjectCollectedException. This less talked about but unavoidable exception often pops up on the radar of Java developers, or rather, in their console report. Let's unravel the nuances of this exception, when and why it occurs, and crucially, how to deal with it effectively.

## Unveiling ObjectCollectedException

First off, let's define what the `ObjectCollectedException` actually is. It belongs to `com.sun.jdi` package, a component of Java Debug Interface. This unchecked exception is thrown to indicate a particular object is unreachable because it has been garbage collected.

```java
com.sun.jdi.ObjectCollectedException
```

This exception often occurs while debugging, when you reference some object, which is already collected by the garbace collector while detaching the debugger. This means, your referenced object no longer exists in the JVM memory space.

## Tracing the root

Let's look at when `ObjectCollectedException` might occur, with an example that triggers such a situation.

```java
public class Main {
    public void run(int index) {
        String message = "Hello, I'm number " + index;
        if (index != 0) {
            run(index-1);
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main test = new Main();
        test.run(10000);
    }
}
```

Here, the `run()` method calls itself recursively till the counter `index == 0`. Because each recursion creates a new `String message`, several `String` objects are created. If you try debugging this program by setting a breakpoint inside the `run()` method and watching the `message` variable, you'll likely see `ObjectCollectedException` as the program creates a large number of objects which the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) garbage collector might decide to clean up.

## Decoding the solution

Now that we know when `ObjectCollectedException` occurs, let's understand how to tackle it. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, but the approach largely involves proper memory management and handling garbage collection effectively.

For the previous example, we can rewrite it to avoid generating a massive number of `String` instances by using `StringBuilder`.

```java
public class Main {
    public void run(int index, StringBuilder message) {
        message.append("Hello, I'm number ").append(index).append('\n');
        if (index != 0) {
            run(index-1, message);
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main test = new Main();
        StringBuilder message = new StringBuilder();
        test.run(10000, message);
        System.out.println(message.toString());
    }
}
```

In addition to the above, here are some tips to avoid the `ObjectCollectedException`:

1. **Avoid Creating Unnecessary Objects:** Reuse objects to avoid the creation of unnecessary objects. This allows for better memory management and less work for the garbage collector. 

2. **Timely Nullification:** If an object is no longer needed, explicitly set its reference to `null`, so that JVM's garbage collector can reclaim the memory.
   
3. **Use Soft Reference:** Alternatively, use of `SoftReference` objects can instruct the garbage collector about your preference for keeping or deleting the reference.

Here is an example of using `SoftReference`:

```java
import java.lang.ref.SoftReference;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main obj = new Main();
        SoftReference<Main> sr = new SoftReference<Main>(obj);
        obj = null;
    }
}
```

In the above code, `obj` is wrapped around `SoftReference`. By setting `obj = null`, the only reference to the `Main` object is a soft reference. This makes the garbage collector free to collect it depending on the JVM's memory usage characteristic.

## Wrapping Up

`ObjectCollectedException` is an integral component of Java programming, which deals with objects that vanish before they're expected to. This exception calls for efficient memory management and effective garbage collection. Using good programming practices such as avoiding unnecessary objects, timely nullification, and `SoftReference`, this exception can be avoided.
