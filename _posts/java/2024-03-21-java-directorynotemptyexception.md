## Introduction
Handling exceptions is an integral part of writing robust and reliable code in Java. One common exception that developers encounter when dealing with directories is `DirectoryNotEmptyException`. In this article, we will dive deep into understanding what `DirectoryNotEmptyException` is, how it can be thrown, and various techniques to handle it effectively.

## Understanding DirectoryNotEmptyException
`DirectoryNotEmptyException` is a subclass of the `FileSystemException` class introduced in Java 7. It is thrown when an attempt is made to delete or move a non-empty directory using the `Files.delete(Path)` or `Files.move(Path, Path)` methods, respectively.

The exception occurs when the specified directory is not empty, meaning it contains one or more files or subdirectories. To delete or move a directory, it must be empty, or the entire directory tree must be moved or deleted.

## Scenarios that Trigger DirectoryNotEmptyException
`DirectoryNotEmptyException` can be thrown in several scenarios, which include:

1. Deletion of a directory that is not empty using `Files.delete(Path)` method.
2. Moving a directory using `Files.move(Path, Path)` method, where the target directory is not empty.

In both cases, the exceptions are triggered due to the fact that the specified directories are not empty, violating the prerequisites of these operations.

## Handling DirectoryNotEmptyException
To handle `DirectoryNotEmptyException`, we need to consider the following approaches:

### Recursive Deletion Method
One way to handle `DirectoryNotEmptyException` is to recursively delete all files and subdirectories within the target directory before attempting to delete the directory itself. Here is an example:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.DirectoryNotEmptyException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;

public class DirectoryDeletionExample {
    public static void deleteDirectory(Path directory) throws IOException {
        Files.walk(directory)
                .sorted(Comparator.reverseOrder())
                .map(Path::toFile)
                .forEach(File::delete);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Path directoryPath = Path.of("path/to/directory");

        try {
            deleteDirectory(directoryPath);
        } catch (DirectoryNotEmptyException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            // Handle the exception gracefully
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            // Handle other IO exceptions if necessary
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we use the `Files.walk(Path)` method to recursively traverse the directory tree starting from the specified directory. The `sorted()` method ensures that files and subdirectories are processed in a reversed order. Finally, `map()` is used to convert each `Path` to a `File` object, which can be deleted using the `delete()` method.

### Graceful Error Handling
Another way to handle `DirectoryNotEmptyException` is to handle the exception gracefully by informing the user about the non-empty directory and providing options for further actions. Here is an example:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.DirectoryNotEmptyException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class MoveDirectoryExample {
    public static void moveDirectory(Path source, Path target) throws IOException {
        try {
            Files.move(source, target);
        } catch (DirectoryNotEmptyException e) {
            System.out.println("The target directory is not empty.");
            System.out.println("Do you want to merge the directories? (Y/N)");
            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
            String input = scanner.nextLine();

            if (input.equalsIgnoreCase("Y")) {
                mergeDirectories(source, target);
            } else {
                System.out.println("Operation canceled.");
            }
        }
    }

    public static void mergeDirectories(Path source, Path target) throws IOException {
        // Logic to merge directories
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Path sourceDirectory = Path.of("path/to/source");
        Path targetDirectory = Path.of("path/to/target");

        try {
            moveDirectory(sourceDirectory, targetDirectory);
        } catch (DirectoryNotEmptyException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            // Handle other IO exceptions if necessary
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we catch the `DirectoryNotEmptyException` when attempting to move the source directory to the target directory. Instead of halting the operation, we display a message to the user, giving them the option to merge the directories if desired. If the user chooses to merge, we can implement the `mergeDirectories()` method to perform the merging logic.

## Conclusion
In this article, we explored the `DirectoryNotEmptyException` in Java. We discussed its purpose, scenarios where it can be triggered, and various strategies to handle it effectively. By employing techniques like recursive deletion and graceful error handling, we can ensure our code gracefully handles non-empty directory scenarios, enhancing the reliability and robustness of our applications.

Remember, when working with directories, it's crucial to consider edge cases like non-empty directories to avoid unexpected behavior or data loss.
