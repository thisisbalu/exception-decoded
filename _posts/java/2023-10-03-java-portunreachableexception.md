PortUnreachableException is a type of exception that many Java developers may deal with, especially those working on networking applications. 

In this article, we shall take a close look at `PortUnreachableException`, its causes, ways to handle it, and how to avoid it. We'll deep-dive into the Java code to understand this exception better and see how we can write cleaner, more efficient, and error-free programs. Buckle up, and let's get into it!

## Understanding Java Exceptions

Before diving into the specifics of `PortUnreachableException`, it's crucial to have a solid understanding of Java exceptions and their role in the language.

Java exceptions are events that disrupt the typical flow of a program and occur during the execution of a program. They differ from errors and are typically divided into two categories: checked exceptions (which must be declared in a method or a constructor's `throws` clause if they can be thrown by the execution of the method or constructor and propagate outside) and unchecked exceptions (which are not required to be caught or declared in a method).

For more on Java Exceptions, and the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions in Java, check out the comprehensive guide at [Java Exceptions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/).

## What is `PortUnreachableException`?

`PortUnreachableException` is a subclass of the `SocketException` class, and like its name suggests, this exception is thrown to indicate that an ICMP Port Unreachable message has been received on a connected datagram.

In simpler terms, this Exception is thrown when a program sends a datagram to a network port that isn't open for communication, or which is unreachable.

## Handling the `PortUnreachableException`

```java
try {
    DatagramSocket socket = new DatagramSocket();

    byte[] buf = new byte[256];
    InetAddress address = InetAddress.getByName("www.somehost.com");
    DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(buf, buf.length, address, 4445);
    socket.send(packet);
    
    // receive response
    packet = new DatagramPacket(buf, buf.length);
    socket.receive(packet);
} catch (PortUnreachableException e) {
    System.err.println("Port is unreachable: " + e.getMessage());
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In this example, a datagram packet is trying to be sent to port 4455. If that port is closed or inaccessible, a `PortUnreachableException` will be thrown, which we've caught and handle by merely printing an error message to the console.

## Prevention of `PortUnreachableException`

Preventing `PortUnreachableException` involves ensuring that the target port is open and available for communication. This procedure might involve checking the port status before trying to send data to it. 

Doing so can potentially be complex due to the inherently asynchronous nature of network programming, and might involve using tools or libraries designed for network management and diagnostics.

## Conclusion

The `PortUnreachableException` in Java is a specific type of exception that deals with network communication. By understanding this exception type and knowing how to handle it, you can create more robust and secure network applications.

While error handling is necessary and beneficial, the true art of programming lies in preventing these errors from occurring in the first place. Make sure to follow proper network programming practices and always check your network port's status before attempting any communication.

Remember, a great Java developer doesn't just know how to write Java code, but how to handle and prevent errors, leading to more efficient, effective, and manageable applications.
