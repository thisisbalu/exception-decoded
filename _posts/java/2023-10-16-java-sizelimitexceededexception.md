As a Java developer, you're likely to have encountered a variety of exceptions and errors while running your applications. Some of those issues might be easy to handle, while others are quite complicated, puzzling even the most experienced developers. One exception that could cause considerable challenge for many is the `SizeLimitExceededException`. In this blog, we are going to traverse the ins and outs of `SizeLimitExceededException`, understanding why it occurs, and how we can deal with it.

## What is SizeLimitExceededException?

The `SizeLimitExceededException` is a subclass of `LimitExceededException` that is thrown when a result exceeds a size limit. This exception is most common when dealing with LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol). In essence, it occurs when the result returned from an operation exceeds the limit specified by the directory service [[1]](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.naming/javax/naming/SizeLimitExceededException.html).

A classic representation of this exception can be seen below:

```java
javax.naming.SizeLimitExceededException: [LDAP: error code 4 - Sizelimit Exceeded]; remaining name 'ou=test,dc=example,dc=com'
```

## Why does SizeLimitExceededException occur?

There are numerous situations that could cause `SizeLimitExceededException` to occur.

- **Exceeding LDAP Maximum Limit:** When dealing with LDAP, it specifies max results that can be fetched by a single query. If you try to access or fetch more records than this specified limit, `SizeLimitExceededException` will be thrown [[2]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31187873/handle-sizelimit-exceeded-exception).

```java
try {
    NamingEnumeration<SearchResult> results = ctx.search(searchBase, searchFilter, controls);
    while (results != null && results.hasMore()) {    // Exception thrown here
        SearchResult searchResult = results.next();
        // ... processing code ...
    }
} catch (SizeLimitExceededException sle) {
    sle.printStackTrace();
}
```

- **Huge File Size:** In some cases, you may face this exception when trying to read a very large file using certain Java libraries.

## Handling SizeLimitExceededException?

The handling of `SizeLimitExceededException` relies on two basic strategies: managing the query request size and handling the exception elegantly.

- **Manage Query Size:** If we limit our LDAP query size to be within acceptable limits as defined by the LDAP server, we can essentially avoid `SizeLimitExceededException` from being thrown. This approach, however, may not be conceivable in all scenarios [[3]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31187873/handle-sizelimit-exceeded-exception).

```java
SearchControls controls = new SearchControls();
controls.setCountLimit(MAX_ALLOWED_SIZE); // MAX_ALLOWED_SIZE is within acceptable limit
```

- **Elegant Exception Handling:** We can handle this exception elegantly and perform another search operation from where it left off until all required records are fetched. 

```java
try {
    NamingEnumeration<SearchResult> results = ctx.search(searchBase, searchFilter, controls);
    while (results != null && results.hasMore()) {
        SearchResult searchResult = results.next();
        // ... processing code ...
    }
} catch (SizeLimitExceededException sle) {
    sle.printStackTrace();
    // Perform another search operation from where it left off
    String continuationPoint = ... // determine the continuation point
    // Use the continuationPoint to perform another search operation
}
```

## Conclusion

As we have seen, `SizeLimitExceededException` is primarily thrown when the LDAP result size exceeds the limit specified by the service. To manage this, we learned about setting the query size properly and handling exceptions gracefully, thus ensuring the smooth functioning of our Java applications even in the face of potential exceptions. Remember, the key to dealing with exceptions is understanding them at the root level and taking appropriate actions rather than ignoring them.
