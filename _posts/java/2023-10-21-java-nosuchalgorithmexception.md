The intricate world of programming relies heavily on handling exceptions to ensure a smooth application run. While scripting in Java, you might have encountered a particular type of exception known as `NoSuchAlgorithmException`. This article dives deep into `NoSuchAlgorithmException`, its causes, consequences, and the various ways to manage it. Let's gear up!

## Understanding Exceptions in Java

In Java, exceptions are unwanted events that disrupt the normal execution of a program. The language comes with a dedicated [Exception Handling Framework](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/) that helps to categorize, manage, and rectify these exceptions. The three main categories are checked exceptions, unchecked exceptions, and errors. `NoSuchAlgorithmException` is a checked exception.

```java
try {
   // code that may raise an exception
} catch (SomeException e) {
   // code to handle the exception
}
```

## Introduction to NoSuchAlgorithmException

The `NoSuchAlgorithmException` is a type of exception that is thrown when a request for a particular cryptographic algorithm is made to the Security API, but it's unable to find the algorithm. To be more precise, it occurs when the specified algorithm is not available in the environment.
 
```java
try {
   MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("Unknown-Algorithm");
} catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
   System.err.println("I'm sorry, but Unknown-Algorithm is not available. \\n" + e.getMessage());
}
```
## Causes of NoSuchAlgorithmException

The `NoSuchAlgorithmException` mainly occurs due to the unavailability of the requested algorithm, as the exception name reveals it. Here are some reasons why it generally happens:

- The requested algorithm is not provided by any of the installed providers.
- The algorithm requested could be uninstalled or not available anymore due to security settings.

## Resolving NoSuchAlgorithmException

To manage `NoSuchAlgorithmException`, a few commonly employed ways are:

- Before invoking the algorithm, validate its existence.
- Adopt error-proof coding by using try-catch blocks or declaring the method to throw an exception.
- Make sure to use only standard cryptographic algorithm names.

```java
try{
    SecretKeyFactory skf = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1");
} catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e){
    System.err.println("Algorithm Not Found!");
}
```

## Real-Life Coding Examples

Let's understand the concept better with a real-world example of Password Hashing using `PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1` algorithm.

```java
import javax.crypto.SecretKeyFactory;
import javax.crypto.spec.PBEKeySpec;
import java.math.BigInteger;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
import java.security.spec.InvalidKeySpecException;
import java.security.spec.KeySpec;

public class PasswordHash {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String password = "123456";
        
        try {
            byte[] salt = new byte[16];
            KeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(), salt, 65536, 128);
            SecretKeyFactory factory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1");
            
            byte[] hash = factory.generateSecret(spec).getEncoded();
            System.out.println("Hashed Password = " + toHex(hash));
        } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException | InvalidKeySpecException e) {
            System.err.println("Exception encountered \n" + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    private static String toHex(byte[] hash) {
        BigInteger bi = new BigInteger(1, hash);
        return String.format("%0" + (hash.length << 1) + "x", bi);
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Built into the Java security architecture, NoSuchAlgorithmException is a common exception that arises while processing cryptographic algorithms. By incorporating error handling techniques into the code and validating the algorithm, this exception can be successfully managed.
