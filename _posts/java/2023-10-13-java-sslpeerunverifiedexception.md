Encountering a Java exception with cryptic error message like `javax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException: peer not authenticated` can be truly daunting. Let's decode the mystery behind this error and learn how to troubleshoot it effectively.

## Introduction to SSLPeerUnverifiedException

To begin with, the `SSLPeerUnverifiedException` in Java arises when the SSL peer could not be verified. This typically occurs when the security certificate presented by the host server or client isn't trusted by the system processing the request.

This SSL-related exception is encapsulated in the `javax.net.ssl` package which provides the classes needed to create secure socket connections via SSL/TLS protocol.

```java
import javax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException;
```

Now, let's delve deeper to comprehend the full scope of `SSLPeerUnverifiedException` and how to handle it proficiently.

## Causes of SSLPeerUnverifiedException

### Untrusted Certificates 

The most common cause of `SSLPeerUnverifiedException` is when Java application doesn't trust the certificate provided by the opposite party (client or server).

Java supports SSL communication through TrustStores and KeyStores. TrustStore is a repository of certificates from trusted SSL servers. If the presented certificate isn't within the TrustStore, Java throws `SSLPeerUnverifiedException`.

```java
SSLSession session = sslSocket.getSession();
try {
  session.getPeerCertificates();
} catch (SSLPeerUnverifiedException e){
  e.printStackTrace();
}
```

### Certificate Absence  

There are scenarios where the client or server doesn't provide an SSL certificate during an SSL handshake, leading to `SSLPeerUnverifiedException`.

```java
public ArrayList<String> getServerCerts(SSLSocket socket) throws SSLPeerUnverifiedException {
  SSLSession session = socket.getSession();

  Certificate[] certificates = null;
  try {
    certificates = session.getPeerCertificates();
  } catch (SSLPeerUnverifiedException e){
    throw new SSLPeerUnverifiedException("No certificate from the server");
  }

  ArrayList<String> results = new ArrayList<String>();

  for (Certificate certificate : certificates) {
    results.add(certificate.toString());
  }

  return results;
}
```

## Effective Handling of SSLPeerUnverifiedException

Encountering `SSLPeerUnverifiedException` doesn't mean catastrophic failure. Proper handling can save the day.

### Adding Certificate to Java TrustStore

If a website's certificate isn't in your TrustStore, adding the certificate can resolve the issue. But exercise caution while updating TrustStore, as blindly trusting certificates opens you to potential security risks.

```bash
keytool -importcert -file certificate.crt -alias "Alias" -keystore Truststore.jks
```

### Certificate Verification

Authenticate the SSL certificate to give your application the green light for a secure connection. Here is a simple snippet for setting up SSL certificate verification using `HttpsURLConnection`.

```java
URL url = new URL("https://example.com");
HttpsURLConnection conn = (HttpsURLConnection)url.openConnection();
conn.setHostnameVerifier((hostname, session) -> true);
```

## Conclusion

Grasping the fundamentals of `javax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException` in Java can help you maintain smooth and secure applications. SSL is a complex beast, so remember to always adhere to best practices. Adding untrusted certificates to your TrustStore or disabling certification validation should only be a last resort, as they expose to security risks.

Remember - the integrity of SSL lies in the web of trust established by the digital certificates, the TrustStore and KeyStore. Breaking this chain inadvertently might lead to unexpected surprises.
