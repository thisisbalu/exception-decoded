In this blog post, we are going to take a detailed look at Java's `EnumConstantNotPresentException`. We’ll clarify what this exception means, when it occurs, and how to handle it efficiently. If you're a Java developer, chances are you've experienced or will experience this exception, so let's tame this beast together! 

## Primer on Java's Enums 

Before diving into the `EnumConstantNotPresentException`, let's understand the concept of [Enums in Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html). 

An Enum is a special data type that enables a variable to be a set of predefined constants. The variable must be equal to one of the values that have been predefined for it. Enums increase code clarity and ensure safer and more reliable code by allowing us to restrict a variable to a predefined set of constants.

```java
public enum Weekday {
    MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY
}
```

## Unleashing EnumConstantNotPresentException 

Now let's explore the main topic of our discussion - `EnumConstantNotPresentException`. This is a form of `RuntimeException` that Java throws when an application tries to access an enum constant by name and that enum constant is not present in the enum type. 

This usually happens in scenarios where an application was compiled with an enum type that has since changed by adding or removing constants. 

```java
Weekday myDay = Enum.valueOf(Weekday.class, "FUNDAY"); // FUNDAY is not in our Enum
```

Executing this code throws an exception:

```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: 
No enum constant com.example.Weekday.FUNDAY
```

Now we can see an instance of our protagonist, the `EnumConstantNotPresentException`. 

## Handling EnumConstantNotPresentException

The most straightforward solution to avoid `EnumConstantNotPresentException` is to handle it with a `try-catch` block:

```java
try {
 Weekday myDay = Enum.valueOf(Weekday.class, "FUNDAY");
} catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
 System.out.println("Enum constant not found");
}
```

However, in practice, the problem may not be this simple. What if the enum is being referenced in libraries you are not directly responsible for, or it might be referenced in serialized objects where the type information is coming from a different source, like a saved file or a network?

The `EnumConstantNotPresentException` is closely related to the issues of Java’s forward and backward compatibility. When a new version of a library removes an enum that an old version is using, the JVM is bound to throw an `EnumConstantNotPresentException`.

## Safeguard Against EnumConstantNotPresentException 

To safeguard against such anomalies in code, you need to have proper testing strategies that test across different versions of the system and catch these issues during the testing phase. Also, having an awareness about changes in the libraries that your code depends on is crucial.

Alternatively, you can use defensive programming strategies, like checking for `null` or `IllegalArgumentException`, and falling back to a default value if the desired enum constant is not present.

```java
public Weekday getDay(String day){
    try {
        return Weekday.valueOf(day);
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException ex) {
        return Weekday.MONDAY; // default
    }
}
```

This way, your code won't break even if specific enum constants are not present.

## Conclusion

With this, we have uncovered the `EnumConstantNotPresentException` and ways to tame it. Remember, knowledge of such exception case is especially important when dealing with enums across different versions of an application or when using 3rd party libraries that might be evolving separately from your app. 

To deep dive into Java exceptions, you can check out the [official Java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/EnumConstantNotPresentException.html). The more you're familiar with these, the easier it becomes to write robust and efficient code. Happy Coding!
