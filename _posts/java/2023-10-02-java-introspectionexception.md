Java, a robust and object-oriented programming language, boasts of an array of in-built exception handling mechanisms, and `IntrospectionException` is among the repertoire. Designed to be a flexible language, Java's Introspection API aids programmers in managing and debugging codes with competence. This article presents a comprehensive discourse on the IntrospectionException in Java, its usage, and strategies to handle, with the inclusion of detailed code examples. 

## 1. Understanding Java Introspection and IntrospectionException

Java Introspection is an element of Java Reflection API and contributes significantly to examining the design of classes at runtime. Introspection API helps inspect and manipulate the properties of a class and is widely used in JavaBeans, where it can handle new properties without requiring modifications in the existing code.

Now, the IntrospectionException, a subclass of Exception, is thrown during the introspection operation when something fishy is encountered in a bean's class or interface declaration.

This code snippet shows how introspection can be used:

```java
    BeanInfo info = Introspector.getBeanInfo(SomeBean.class);
    PropertyInfo[] props = info.getPropertyDescriptors();
```
So the IntrospectionException may occur while getting bean information using the `Introspector.getBeanInfo()` method.

## 2. Examples of Scenarios Leading to IntrospectionException

Here are two scenarios where the IntrospectionException is most likely to arise:

   - When a program tries accessing a non-existent property on a JavaBean. 
   - When an introspection call is made on a class that does not follow JavaBeans design patterns.

Let's delve into the above situations with hands-on code examples:

**2.1 Accessing a Non-Existent Property**

```java
   public class MissingProperty {
       private String name;
   }
```

If we try to access a property that doesn't exist in the MissingProperty class, the Introspector will throw an IntrospectionException.

**2.2 Improper JavaBean Design**

The below code illustrates a class that doesn't follow the JavaBeans guidelines. Here, the `getName()` method doesn't match the property "name".

```java
   public class WrongBean {
       private String notName;

       public String getName() {
           return notName;
       }
   }
```

In this case, an IntrospectionException will be thrown since the property "name" is not found.

## 3. Dealing with IntrospectionException

Understanding the cause of an IntrospectionException is key to handle it effectively. Once we identify the root of the problem, we can apply the appropriate solutions.

For instance, if the exception is because of a non-existent property, ensure that the JavaBean contains the required property. Similarly, for cases where the JavaBean design is not proper, follow JavaBeans naming conventions.

```java
    public class CorrectBean {
        private String name;

        public String getName() {
            return this.name;
        }
    }
```
The above class represents a typical, well-designed JavaBean following conventions.

## 4. Debugging with IntrospectionException

Debugging is another critical aspect while managing any exception. In IntrospectionException, the details of it can be captured via `printStackTrace()` method.

```java
    try {
        BeanInfo info = Introspector.getBeanInfo(WrongBean.class);
    } catch (IntrospectionException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
```
Debugging the exception will reveal enough further details on why it's occurring.

So, in conclusion, the IntrospectionException arises when there's something amiss with the class or bean declaration that we're introspecting â€“ it could be a missing property or non-adherence to JavaBean conventions. With an understanding of the Introspection API and proper debugging mechanisms, one can efficiently manage the IntrospectionException.
