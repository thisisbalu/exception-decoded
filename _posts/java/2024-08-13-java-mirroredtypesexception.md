If you’ve been working with Java and the reflection API, chances are you might have encountered the `MirroredTypesException` at some point. This exception is a common stumbling block for developers who are exploring the powerful capabilities of Java reflection. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve deep into what `MirroredTypesException` is, how to handle it, and explore some best practices to avoid it altogether.

## Understanding the MirroredTypesException

`MirroredTypesException` is a checked exception that is thrown by the `getDeclaredAnnotationsByType(Class<T> annotationClass)` method of the `java.lang.reflect.AnnotatedElement` interface. This exception is part of the Java Language Specification (JLS) and is specifically related to the retrieval of annotation types.

In Java, annotations help provide additional metadata for classes, fields, and methods. With reflection, it is possible to access and analyze these annotations at runtime. However, when retrieving annotations that are declared using a class literal, the `MirroredTypesException` may be thrown.

## Why MirroredTypesException Occurs

To understand why `MirroredTypesException` occurs, let’s consider a scenario where we have an annotation `@MyAnnotation` that takes an array of classes as an attribute. For example:

```java
public @interface MyAnnotation {
    Class<?>[] value();
}
```

Now, let’s say we have a class `MyClass` that uses this annotation:

```java
@MyAnnotation({String.class, Integer.class})
public class MyClass {
    // Class implementation
}
```

To retrieve the value of the `@MyAnnotation` array attribute using reflection, we might use the following code:

```java
MyAnnotation myAnnotation = MyClass.class.getAnnotation(MyAnnotation.class);
Class<?>[] classes = myAnnotation.value();
```

This seems like a straightforward approach, but here’s where things get tricky. If the `@MyAnnotation` is defined in an external library that we don’t have direct access to, and the annotation’s attribute value cannot be resolved during compile-time, the `MirroredTypesException` is thrown.

The exception is essentially a wrapper exception signaling that the annotation’s attribute cannot be resolved to its actual type, which is only possible at runtime due to type erasure.

## Handling MirroredTypesException

When encountering `MirroredTypesException`, it is important to remember that it is a checked exception. Thus, you have to explicitly declare it in the method signature or handle it using try-catch blocks.

The exception provides a way to retrieve the type elements that caused the exception through its `getTypeMirrors()` method. With this information, you can analyze and handle the exception accordingly.

Let’s take a look at an example:

```java
try {
    MyAnnotation myAnnotation = MyClass.class.getAnnotation(MyAnnotation.class);
    Class<?>[] classes = myAnnotation.value();
} catch (MirroredTypesException mte) {
    List<? extends TypeMirror> typeMirrors = mte.getTypeMirrors();
    // Handle the exception accordingly
}
```

By using the `getTypeMirrors()` method, we can obtain the type mirrors that caused the exception, allowing us to process them as needed.

## Best Practices to Avoid MirroredTypesException

Although `MirroredTypesException` can be managed when encountered, it is always best to avoid it altogether whenever possible. Here are some best practices to help you sidestep this exception:

### 1. Use `ClassLiteralConverter` with Compile-time Constant Values

To avoid `MirroredTypesException`, a good practice is to use the `ClassLiteralConverter` library that can handle class literals with compile-time constants at runtime. The `ClassLiteralConverter` is a compile-time annotation processor that automatically resolves class literals to their corresponding types.

You can add `ClassLiteralConverter` to your project by including the following dependency in your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.toolisticon.annotationprocessortoolkit</groupId>
    <artifactId>annotation-processortoolkit-classliteralconverter</artifactId>
    <version>0.9.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

Once added, use the `@ClassLiteral` annotation to indicate that a class literal should be resolved at compile-time. For example:

```java
@MyAnnotation({@ClassLiteral(String.class), @ClassLiteral(Integer.class)})
public class MyClass {
    // Class implementation
}
```

By following this approach, the `MirroredTypesException` can be avoided completely.

### 2. Prefer `TypeLiteral` Over `Class`

Another way to avoid `MirroredTypesException` is to use the `TypeLiteral` class from the `javax.inject` package instead of `Class<?>` when defining annotations. The `TypeLiteral` represents a generic type `T` and provides a way to capture any generic type with type information.

For instance, instead of using:

```java
public @interface MyAnnotation {
    Class<?>[] value();
}
```

You can use:

```java
public @interface MyAnnotation {
    TypeLiteral<?>[] value();
}
```

This change allows you to retain the type information at runtime and completely avoid `MirroredTypesException`.

### 3. Use Type Information and Generics

When working with reflection, it is important to leverage the type information available at runtime. Instead of making assumptions and relying on class literals alone, use type information available within the program to avoid `MirroredTypesException` scenarios.

By utilizing generics and type information, you can define your annotations in a way that eliminates the need for class literals and hence, bypasses the reflection-related exceptions altogether.

## Conclusion

In this article, we delved into the world of `MirroredTypesException` in Java, understanding why it occurs and how it can be handled. We also explored some best practices to avoid encountering this reflection exception in the first place.

Although `MirroredTypesException` might seem like an obstacle, armed with the knowledge gained from this article, you are now ready to tackle this exception head-on. By applying best practices and thoughtful design, you can harness the full power of reflection in Java without getting caught up in `MirroredTypesException` predicaments.
