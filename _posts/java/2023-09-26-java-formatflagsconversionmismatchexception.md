When operating within the vast universe of the Java programming language, encountering various exceptions is inevitable. However, understanding these exceptions is crucial for writing robust and error-free code. One such exception that often leaves developers scratching their heads is the `FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException`. In this article, delve into the mysterious world of this unique and special exception. This piece of writing will shed light on what it is, when it occurs, how to handle and avoid it. Packed with illustrative code examples, we will journey from the roots of the issue to its resolutions.

## An Introduction to FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException in Java

`FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException` is a part of `java.util` package. It's a subclass of `IllegalFormatException`. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) throws this exception when there is a mismatch between the conversion specification and format flag. Typically, it happens when you are trying to print out a value, and the format of the value is not appropriate for the given flag.

Let's consider a simple example that Demonstrates this:

```java
import java.util.Formatter;  
public class FormatFlagDemo {  
      public static void main(String args[]) {  
           Formatter f = new Formatter();  
           System.out.println(f.format("%#", 10));  
      }  
}  
```

Running this code would throw `FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException`, as the format `#` symbol expects a hexadecimal or floating-point, rather than an integer.

## Identifying When FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException Occurs 

To identify exactly when this particular exception can occur, let's break it down. 

1. Whenever an application tries to convert a hexadecimal value to an octal, or vice versa, and uses an invalid flag. 
2. When using `#` or `-` flags with `%n` and `%%` conversions. 
3. Using `#` flag with non-decimal conversions such as `%c`, `%i`, `%d`, etc. 

Now, let's see some of these scenarios unfold in code:

```java
import java.util.Formatter;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Formatter f = new Formatter();
        System.out.println(f.format("%#d",10));
   }
}
```

The output will be:

`java.util.FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException: Conversion = d, Flags = #`

`%d` is a decimal integer, and the `#` symbol in the format specification expects a hexadecimal or floating-point.

## Handling FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException 

As with any exception in Java, it is essential to properly handle `FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException` to prevent your program from crashing.

One simple way to do this is by using a `try-catch` block. Let's look at an example where the code tries to format an integer and catch the exception in case of a format mismatch:

```java
import java.util.Formatter;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try
        {
            Formatter f = new Formatter();
            System.out.println(f.format("%#d",10));
        }
        catch (java.util.FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException e)
        {
            System.out.println("Caught exception: " + e.getMessage());
            // handle exception here
        }
    }
}
```

## Avoiding the FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException 

The simplest way to avoid this exception is by ensuring there is a match between conversion specification and format flag.

If you are using hexadecimal, octal or floating-point conversions, use the `#` symbol appropriately.

```java
import java.util.Formatter;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Formatter f = new Formatter();
        System.out.println(f.format("%#x",100));    //prints 0x64
    }
}
```

In the above code, we use `%#x`, which is a valid combination since `x` is intended for hexadecimal conversion and the use of `#` is correct.

## In Conclusion 

The `FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException` may seem daunting at first glance, but with proper understanding about the mismatches of the conversion specification and format flags, you can easily avoid it. Always implement best practices, which in this case would be to make sure your formatting strings are correct based on the type of data you expect to format.

Remember, "Error-free coding leads to stress-free coding!"
