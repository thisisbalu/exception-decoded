There comes a time in every Java developer's journey when they encounter peculiar exceptions, a kink in their armor of code. One such commonly encountered exception is the MidiUnavailableException. Skimming through this article, you'll learn about what causes this exception, its implications, and how you can work around or resolve it with ample code examples to elucidate.

## Meet the Exception: MidiUnavailableException 

Before delving into the intricacies, let’s acquaint with the basics. By definition, a [MidiUnavailableException](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/sound/midi/MidiUnavailableException.html) is an exception that’s indicated in situations where a requested MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) device cannot be opened or accessed because it’s unavailable.

```java
class MidiUnavailableException extends Exception
```
MidiUnavailableException extends the [Exception class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Exception.html), and is specifically thrown when a MIDI device is unavailable or inaccessible.

This Exception might surface in a situation like this:

```java
// Importing necessary libraries
import javax.sound.midi.*;

public class MidiTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Open the default sequencer
            Sequencer sequencer = MidiSystem.getSequencer(false);
            sequencer.open();
        } catch (MidiUnavailableException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
In the above example, if the default sequencer is unavailable, a MidiUnavailableException could be thrown. 

## Managing MidiUnavailableException

While navigating through the labyrinth of MidiUnavailableException, it's crucial to manage or handle this exception deliberately to avoid application crash. In Java, exceptions can be handled by either `try-catch` or `throw`.

**Try-Catch:** 

Here’s an example where the exception is handled using try-catch -

```java
import javax.sound.midi.*;

public class MidiTest 
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        try 
        {
            Sequencer sequencer = MidiSystem.getSequencer();
            sequencer.open();
        } 
        catch(MidiUnavailableException e) 
        {
            System.out.println("MIDI Device Unavailable");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
Here, if a MidiUnavailableException occurs, it is caught and handled in the catch block, preventing the program from terminating abnormally.

**Throw:**

Alternatively, you could throw the exception back to the calling method using `throws`. 

```java
import javax.sound.midi.*;

public class MidiTest 
{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws MidiUnavailableException 
    {
        Sequencer sequencer = MidiSystem.getSequencer();
        sequencer.open();
    }
}
```
Note: In this context, it becomes the responsibility of the calling method to handle the exception.

## Strategies to Resolve MidiUnavailableException

1. **Check System Resources:** Ensure that your system resources aren't stretched thin. If another application is monopolizing the MIDI system, free up resources and retry.

2. **Try Different Sequencer:** The default sequencer varies depending on the system. Hence, consider choosing a different sequencer if the default one is unavailable. 

3. **Third-party Libraries:** As a last resort, one might opt for third-party libraries like [Java MIDI API](https://github.com/DerekCook/CoreMidi4J) to handle MIDI devices more effectively.

In this never-ending exploration of Java exceptions and their management, the MidiUnavailableException represents yet another landmark. Here's hoping that this guide has equipped you better to handle and resolve this pesky exception.

Happy Programming!
