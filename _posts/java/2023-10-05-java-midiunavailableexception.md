Did you face any issues while dealing with MIDI devices or software in Java Sound API? Got stuck with the MidiUnavailableException? No worries! In this blog post, we are going to delve into the depths of this annoying exception, and shine some light on how you can handle it effectively in your Java application. 

## What is MidiUnavailableException?

To start off, `MidiUnavailableException` is a type of `Exception` which is thrown when a requested MIDI device cannot be opened or accessed -- it's simply unavailable. This could be due to a variety of reasons, from the requested resource being already in use to the MIDI device not being present at all.

Let's put things into context; when we attempt to access a MIDI device that is already in use, for instance, a synthesizer, sequencer, or receiver, we come across this exception. This is an example: 

```java
import javax.sound.midi.*;

public class MidiTest {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
     try {
       Synthesizer midiSynth = MidiSystem.getSynthesizer(); 
       midiSynth.open();
     } catch (MidiUnavailableException mue) {
       System.out.println("MidiUnavailableException caught - device unavailable");
     } 
   }
}
```

## Handling MidiUnavailableException

### Exception Checking

Now that we have a basic understanding, let's talk about how we can handle this exception. Firstly, we need to put the code that might throw `MidiUnavailableException` inside a `try catch` block. In the `catch` block, we catch the exception and then handle it appropriately.

This can be as simple as a print statement:

```java
catch (MidiUnavailableException mue) {
   System.out.println("MidiUnavailableException caught - device unavailable");
}
```

However, just printing exceptions isn't good practice in a real-world application, as it's not the most effective way of tracking or handling exceptions.

### Proper Exception Handling

For better exception handling, we can log the exception using a logger:

```java
catch (MidiUnavailableException mue) {
   logger.error("MidiUnavailableException caught", mue);
}
```

You could also choose to rethrow the exception with a custom message to better understand the cause of the problem:

```java
catch (MidiUnavailableException mue) {
   throw new MidiUnavailableException("The MIDI device is unavailable", mue);
}
```

## How to Avoid MidiUnavailableException

Actually, avoiding the `MidiUnavailableException` is quite simpler than handling it. There are two common checks that we can perform to ensure we don't stumble upon this error.

1. Check if the MIDI device is being used by some other application.
2. Check if the MIDI device is connected.

An example of these checks would be:

```java
public static boolean isMidiDeviceAvailable(MidiDevice device) {
   try {
       device.open();
       return true;
   } catch (MidiUnavailableException mue) {
       return false;
   } finally {
       device.close();
   }
}
```

In the code snippet above, we have a function which checks if a `MidiDevice` can be opened, indicating that the device is available. If the `open()` method call doesn't throw a `MidiUnavailableException`, then the device is available. If it does throw an exception, then we know the device is not available.

In conclusion, despite `MidiUnavailableException` can be a frustrating roadblock when using the Java Sound API, with the right tactics in hand, it can be managed gracefully. 

The best approach to handle exceptions is not only based on the type of exceptions but also the system architecture, application use-case, and clear understanding of why the exception is appearing. 

I hope you've found this piece helpful in understanding the `MidiUnavailableException` in Java. If you have any questions or queries, don't hesitate to ask in the comments below. Stay tuned for more enlightening posts on Java exceptions!
