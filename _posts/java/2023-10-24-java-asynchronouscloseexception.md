In this article, we're going to demystify what happens behind the scenes of the `AsynchronousCloseException` in Java. This is an essential aspect of exception handling within Java's programming environment that every Java developer should comprehend. We will go through the introduction of `AsynchronousCloseException`, reasons for its occurrence, and how to handle it with examples.

## Understanding AsynchronousCloseException

`AsynchronousCloseException` is a form of `ClosedChannelException`, which extends the `IOException`. It is thrown when an I/O operation is interrupted by closing its originating channel. 

In Java's NIO package (java.nio.channels), an I/O operation being executed by one thread can be interrupted by another thread invoking the `close` method. 

Here's how you might encounter an `AsynchronousCloseException`:

```java
try {
    fileChannel.read(buffer);
} catch (AsynchronousCloseException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In the given I/O operation, if another thread calls the `close` method on `fileChannel` while it's still reading, an `AsynchronousCloseException` is thrown.

## Why does AsynchronousCloseException occur?

Mostly, `AsynchronousCloseException` occurs when one thread is engaged in either reading or writing data, and suddenly another thread closes the channel that the first thread uses. This action prompts the JVM to throw an `AsynchronousCloseException`. 

The exception occurs as a fail-fast response to indicate that a lengthy blocking operation has been prematurely terminated, and most part of the data probably hasn't been obtained. 

Consider the code sample below:

```java
Thread newThread = new Thread(() -> {
    try {
        System.out.println("Thread started...");
        fileChannel.read(buffer);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}); 

newThread.start();

Thread.sleep(1000);

newThread.interrupt();
System.out.println("Thread interrupted...");
```

In this code block, a `Thread.sleep(1000)` has been added to ensure the `newThread` has started before it gets interrupted. Once it's interrupted, it throws an `AsynchronousCloseException`.

## How to handle AsynchronousCloseException

Handling exceptions is part and parcel to quality programming. Likewise, handling `AsynchronousCloseException` is no exception. 

Here's a simple demonstration on how to handle an `AsynchronousCloseException`:

```java
try {
    fileChannel.read(buffer);
} catch (AsynchronousCloseException e) {
    System.out.println("AsynchronousCloseException: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

However, such an event might be a symptom of a larger issue. It might be an indication that your threads are not working together properly, or you may need to consider adding synchronization. So, proper identification and handling of `AsynchronousCloseException` can help prevent potential havoc in a program's execution flow. 

## Conclusion

We have gone through what an `AsynchronousCloseException` is, why it happens, and how to deal with it. Understanding the nature of `AsynchronousCloseException` is crucial within the context of Java's NIO. It ensures that we write code that can handle exceptions gracefully to improve application reliability.
