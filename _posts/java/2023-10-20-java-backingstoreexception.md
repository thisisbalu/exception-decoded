Java Exception Handling is one of the most advantageous and critical features that separate it from other programming languages. As a seasoned programmer or an ambitious beginner, one might come across various types of Java exceptions. To make the journey smooth and productive, it is essential to understand, debug, and handle each one of them effectively. 

In this concrete guide, we are going to deep-dive into `BackingStoreException` in Java. We will explore what it is, why it occurs, how it impacts the functioning of a program, and, most importantly, how to deal with it. 

Get ready to fortify your knowledge about this often-discussed Java exception. Let's get started!

## Understanding BackingStoreException

Introduced in Java 1.4, `BackingStoreException` is a checked exception in Java. We can find it in the preferences package (`java.util.prefs`) of `Java SE Standard Edition` class library. It's thrown to indicate that a preferences operation could not complete due to a failure in the backing store, or a failure to contact the backing store. 

Here's what the declaration looks like:

```java
public class BackingStoreException extends Exception
```

## Encountering BackingStoreException: A Real-World Scenario

Imagine you're working on a Java application where you are using the Preferences API to store, retrieve and manipulate user preferences. When you're attempting to perform an operation like getting, setting, or removing a preference, or trying to query about the backing store, a problem pops up. There is a failure in the backing store's operations or contact, which leads to BackingStoreException. 

Here's an instance to illustrate this: 

```java
import java.util.prefs.*;

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Preferences userPrefs = Preferences.userNodeForPackage(MyObject.class);
            userPrefs.flush(); // Causes the BackingStoreException
        } catch (BackingStoreException bse) {
            // Handle the exception
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we're trying to call `flush()`, a method which forces any changes in the contents of the user preference node into the backing store. If there's an issue with the backing store â€“ say it's unreachable or has crashed, the `flush()` method will throw a `BackingStoreException`.

## Handling BackingStoreException Effectively

Just like any other Java exception, `BackingStoreException` can be caught and handled as you deem fit for your application. Since it's a checked exception, it should either be caught or declared to be thrown in the function you're working with.

Here's a look at handling a `BackingStoreException`:

```java
import java.util.prefs.*;

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Preferences userPrefs = Preferences.userNodeForPackage(MyObject.class);
            userPrefs.flush(); // Causes the BackingStoreException
        } catch (BackingStoreException bse) {
            // Handle the exception
            System.err.println("We faced a problem interacting with the backing store!");
            bse.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this block of code, we try to `flush()` changes to the backing store. In case there's an issue and it throws a `BackingStoreException`, we catch it and handle it by showing an error message and printing the stack trace.

## Conclusion

Having a clear understanding of `BackingStoreException` allows you to handle it properly, making your application more robust and reliable. From beginners to seasoned programmers, knowing how to deal with such exceptions can prove invaluable. This is just one of the many Java exceptions; diving deeper into exception handling can truly make you stand out as a resilient programmer in the ever-developing world of Java programming.
