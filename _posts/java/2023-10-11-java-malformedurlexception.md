Those familiar with Java will understand that it's a language filled with ample esoteric messages and no so pleasing exceptions. One such exception is our subject for today—`MalformedURLException`. In this article's course, we shall deeply explore what a `MalformedURLException` in Java is, when it occurs, and the approaches required to prevent it. Brace yourself, for we delve deep into the sea of Java's exceptions.

## What is MalformedURLException in Java?

The `MalformedURLException` is a subclass of `IOException` that is unacceptable for Java programmers. This exception generally occurs when there's a syntactically incorrect or non-existent URL, thereby signaling users to handle or fix it.

Here's how you declare this exception:

```java
public class MalformedURLException
extends IOException
```

## When does MalformedURLException Occur?

A `MalformedURLException` usually occurs when you're working with URLs in Java and encounter the following situations:

1. The URL parameter does not obey the expected syntax (i.e., it's syntactically incorrect).
2. The URL parameter refers to a non-existent protocol.
3. The URL parameter refers to a non-existent resource.
4. The URL parameter is null.

Let's look at this with a brief code snippet below:

```java
import java.net.URL;
 
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            URL url = new URL(null);
        } catch (java.net.MalformedURLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

Running this example will yield a `java.net.MalformedURLException` as the URL parameter passed is `null`.

## Handling MalformedURLException

Now, let's find out how you can tackle this exception. As the `MalformedURLException` is a checked exception, it compels programmers to handle this exception whenever noticed. And just like other Java exceptions, you can handle the `MalformedURLException` using a `try-catch` block.

Below is a simple illustration of handling `MalformedURLException`:

```java
import java.net.URL;
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            URL url = new URL("htt:://invalid_url.com");
        } catch (java.net.MalformedURLException e) {
            System.out.println("The URL is structurally incorrect. Please fix it.");
        }
    }
}
```

## Preventing MalformedURLException

While we've discussed how and why a `MalformedURLException` might occur, the real trick lies in preventing this exception from happening. Some techniques to do this involve:

1. Validation: Always validate the URL structure before performing an operation on it. You can use regular expressions (regex) for this validation.
2. Null Checks: Always perform null checks before performing any operation on the URL.
3. Encapsulation: Ensure you always encapsulate the URL handling within a `try-catch` block.

Below is an example of using Validation and Null Checks to prevent `MalformedURLException`:

```java
import java.net.URL;
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        String Url = "https://www.example.com";
        
        if(isValid(Url)){
            try {
                URL url = new URL(Url);
            } catch (java.net.MalformedURLException ex) {
                System.out.println("The URL is not valid");
            }
        }
    }

    public static boolean isValid(String url) 
    { 
        String regex = "\\b^(http|https)?://([^\\s]+)$\\b";
        Pattern p = Pattern.compile(regex); 
        if (url == null) { 
            return false; 
        } 
        Matcher m = p.matcher(url); 
        return m.matches(); 
    } 
}
```

In this example, the `isValid` method is used to determine if the entered URL structure is valid. If it’s not, the `MalformedURLException` won’t be thrown as the URL won't be processed further.

In conclusion, despite being a subdued exception in the Java family, `MalformedURLException` can cause major disruptions during URL handling tasks if not properly handled or avoided. As with any programming feature, understanding and mastering exceptions help to create efficient and stable code. I hope this guide lights your path on your Java journey.
