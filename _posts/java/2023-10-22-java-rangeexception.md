Welcome to this in-depth guide where we focus on dealing with one of the most common exceptions in Java, the `RangeException`. In the course of our discussion, we will explain what this exception is, how to handle it, and how to avoid it in your code. This is an essential skill for anyone aiming to write robust and error-free code. Shall we get started?

## Understanding the Java RangeException

To start off, let's clarify that `RangeException` is not part of standard Java's exception hierarchy. Itâ€™s often used in custom codes or third-party libraries where a range-specific validation is performed, and it tends to reflect that an operation was attempted which doesn't fit within a specified range of indices (`IndexOutOfBoundsException`).

Although `RangeException` doesn't exist directly in standard Java, understanding it conceptually helps handle many related exceptions like `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`, and `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

Let's explore them individually.

### **ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException**

This exception is thrown to indicate that an array has been accessed with an illegal index. The index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.

Here is a simple code that may throw this exception:

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    System.out.println(array[5]);
  }
}
```

### **StringIndexOutOfBoundsException**

This exception is a subtype of `IndexOutOfBoundsException` and usually occurs when you try to access character from a string with an invalid index.

For example:

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String str = "Hello World!";
    System.out.println(str.charAt(12));
  }
}
```

### **IndexOutOfBoundsException**

This exception is the superclass of `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` and `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`. Any attempt to access an array or string with an index value that falls outside of its valid range will result in this exception. 

## Handling RangeException-like Errors

There are proven ways to handle Range-like exceptions in Java. The two most common methods are:
1. Checking the index before using it.
2. Using `try-catch` block.

### **Checking the index before using it**

The first and easiest way to prevent such exceptions is by making sure that the index is within the valid range before using it.

Here's how you do it:

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int index = 5;
    if (index>=0 && index<array.length) {
      System.out.println(array[index]);
    }
  }
}
```
### **Using try-catch block**

In Java, we have a mechanism to handle exceptions, known as `try-catch`. It works by capturing the exception in the `try` block and handling it in the `catch` block.

Check this code snippet:
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      int array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
      System.out.println(array[5]);
    } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException ex) {
      System.out.println("Array index is out of bounds!");
    }
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Understanding exceptions and learning how to handle and avoid them is vital for writing high-quality, robust code in Java. Although Java does not have a specific `RangeException`, it does feature related exceptions which tie conceptually to the idea.

Although this article is a good start, there's a whole lot more to learn about exceptions in Java. You can read more in the [Oracle Java documentation on Exceptions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/index.html).

Remember, as the popular saying goes, the best way to become an expert is by practice. Keep coding, keep learning!

Happy Coding!
