Exception handling is the backbone of almost all programming languages, helping programmers debug and fix the often unexpected problems that pop up during code execution. In Java, one such exception is the `NoSuchPaddingException`, relatively unknown but equally crucial in cryptographic programming. This article expounds on this unique exception, its triggers, and how to handle it.

## What is NoSuchPaddingException?

Before diving into the 'NoSuchPaddingException', let's first quickly go through what an 'Exception' is in Java.

```java
try {
    // risky operations
}
catch (Exception e) {
   // handle the exception 
}
```

In Java, an 'Exception' is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program. It is an object which represents a runtime error that can be caught (using try and catch blocks) or declared to be thrown.

`NoSuchPaddingException` is a type of `GeneralSecurityException`. It typically occurs in applications dealing with Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA), specifically in the contexts dealing with cipher padding.

## Delving into Padding and Its Necessity

In cryptography, padding refers to the practice of adding bytes of data to an input plaintext to align it with a particular block size requisite of certain encryption algorithms.

```java
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");
```

Some frequently used paddings include: NoPadding, PKCS1Padding, OAEPWithSHA-1AndMGF1Padding, SSL3Padding, PKCS5Padding, and ISO10126Padding.

When the padding specified in the `Cipher.getInstance()` method is absent in the provider package, the system throws the `NoSuchPaddingException`.

## Dealing with NoSuchPaddingException

_Encountered 'java.security.NoSuchPaddingException'? Don't Panic!_

The typical cause for encountering a `NoSuchPaddingException` is when the padding scheme specified in the `Cipher.getInstance()` method does not match any existing padding schemes, as we have mentioned in the list above. Incorrect spelling, wrong formatting or simply the absence of the padding scheme in the Java cryptographic provider can cause this.

```java
try {
    Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/InvalidPadding");
} catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException | NoSuchPaddingException e) {
    // handle Exception here
}
```

The solution is to correct the padding scheme string in the `Cipher.getInstance()` method or to add the necessary JAR files to your classpath to access the needed provider package containing the desired padding scheme.

## Best Practices for Avoiding NoSuchPaddingException

- Always be aware of the encryption scheme and the padding requirement. Some encryption schemes will not work without the correct padding.
- Pay close attention to the syntax while typing out the padding scheme. Even the smallest typo can result in a `NoSuchPaddingException`.
- Packers like Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy, Bouncy Castle, etc. may have to be added to the classpath if padded encryption is requisitioned, and the JRE does not have the necessary provider package.

## Key Takeaway

Even though `NoSuchPaddingException` is seldom encountered, it is an important concept to familiarize oneself within the domain of cryptographic programming. Having the knowledge to prevent it can make the difference between an efficient, seamless execution and prolonged, frustrating debugging sessions.

Our journey through `NoSuchPaddingException` is a reminder that every exception has its place and significance. Exploring this exception gives valuable insights into an otherwise overlooked aspect of encryption.
