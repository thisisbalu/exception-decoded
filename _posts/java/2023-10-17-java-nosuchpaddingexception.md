Are you a programmer, who finds himself tangled in the exceptions which Java throws at your face? Well, Java, being an object-oriented programming language, has a distinctive approach to handle exceptions. One such exception that leaves many of us scratching our heads is the `NoSuchPaddingException`. Don't fret if you're unfamiliar with this term, as this article will act as a comprehensive guide, helping you understand, manage and prevent such inevitable hitches. 

## Understanding NoSuchPaddingException

Before we dive into the `NoSuchPaddingException`, let's track back and understand Java's exception handling mechanism. In Java, an exception is an 'exceptional' event that surfaces during execution of the program. These exceptions disrupt the normal flow and are handled separately to keep the program from terminating abruptly.

Moving onto `NoSuchPaddingException`, it is a part of Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) and falls under the category of `RuntimeException`. 

While dealing with encryption and decryption, padding plays a vital role, and is tacked at the end of a block to ensure it aligns with the proper length. When an invalid padding is requested during the encryption or decryption process, Java throws `NoSuchPaddingException`.

```java
try {
    Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance("DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding");
} catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException | NoSuchPaddingException ex) {
    ex.printStackTrace();
}
```

In the above example, if the padding `PKCS5Padding` does not exist, then the `NoSuchPaddingException` will be thrown.

## Reasons Behind NoSuchPaddingException

Most common reasons for this exception to appear includes:

- Improper or unavailable padding mechanism,
- Mismatch between the encryption and decryption padding,
- Incorrect cipher initialization.

It’s wise to remember that Java, by default, offers limited strength jurisdiction policy files due to the U.S. export laws constraints. So, if your application requires unrestricted policy files, you might need to download them separately from the Oracle’s official website<sup>[[1]](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jce-all-downloads.html)</sup> and avoid the `NoSuchPaddingException`.

## How to Handle NoSuchPaddingException 

Proper error handling could be a saving grace while managing such exceptions. Below is an example of how we can handle this exception:

```java
try {
    Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");
} catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException | NoSuchPaddingException e) {
    System.out.println("Error while initializing Cipher: " + e.toString());
}
```
In the above example, we're handling the exception by specifically catching `NoSuchAlgorithmException` and `NoSuchPaddingException`. An error message is printed when these exceptions occur, offering better clarity on where and why the exception was thrown.

## Preventing NoSuchPaddingException 

Preventing this exception entirely depends on the underlying cryptographic library. Here are few generic practices:

- Stick with widely used padding schemes like `PKCS5Padding` or `NoPadding` rather study what padding your encryption and decryption process requires,
- Ensure the same padding is used across the encryption and decryption process,
- Avoid using the cipher instance if padding isn't necessary in your code. 
- Stick with the JCA's (Java Cryptography Architecture) standard names<sup>[[2]](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/StandardNames.html)</sup>, to avoid any discrepancies that might lead to `NoSuchPaddingException`.

## Conclusion

Despite `NoSuchPaddingException` being a `RuntimeException`, it has a significant impact on Java-based encryption-decryption-related applications' functionality. Effective handling of this kind of exceptions can add a layer of robustness to your application. So, conquer these exceptions with the power of understanding and effective handling!
