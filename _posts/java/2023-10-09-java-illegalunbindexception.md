In the field of Java programming, exceptions are a common occurence, they can be seen as speed bumps on your road to successful coding. In this comprehensive guide, we're going to take an in-depth look into one such stumbling block known as `IllegalUnbindException` - an often-overlooked challenger within `javax.management` package typically associated with the unbinding of objects from the Java Naming and Directory Interface (`JNDI`).

## Understanding IllegalUnbindException

Before diving headfirst into solving the problem, it's important to understand what `IllegalUnbindException` is all about. It is a checked exception that a `JNDI` client application could potentially encounter while trying to unbind an object from the `JNDI` registry. 

```java
public class IllegalUnbindException extends NamingException
```

It's thrown when an operation attempts to unbind an object from the `JNDI` registry, but the binding does not exist. The standard constructor without arguments initializes any exception instance with `null` as its detail message.

```java
public IllegalUnbindException() {
    super();
}
public IllegalUnbindException(String explanation) {
    super(explanation);
}
```

As seen in the example, it's important to pass `String` explanation to provide a specific error message about why the exception has been thrown. It's also noteworthy to mention that the detail message would be saved for later retrieval by the `Throwable.getMessage()` method.

As a checked exception, it must either be declared in a method or constructor's `throws` clause or be explicitly handled by `try-catch` block in your Java program.

For example:

```java
try {
    // Code that might throw an IllegalUnbindException
} catch (IllegalUnbindException e) {
    // Handle exception
    System.out.println(e.getMessage());
}
```

## Best Practices to Handle IllegalUnbindException 

Now let's move to the main event - how to properly handle this exception in your Java program. In essence, you want to check whether a binding actually exists before trying to unbind it. This can be done by running a `lookup` before the `unbind` operation.

```java
Context context = new InitialContext();
try {
    context.lookup("java:comp/env/myObject");
    context.unbind("java:comp/env/myObject");
} catch (NamingException ne) {
    // Handle the exception
    System.out.println(ne.getMessage());
}
```

To further tighten your application's resilience against unexpected unbinding attempt, you can even add condition to ensure unbinding operation only triggers if the object is indeed bound in the registry.

```java
Object obj = null;
try {
    obj = context.lookup("java:comp/env/myObject");
} catch (NameNotFoundException ne) {
    System.out.println("The name does not exist");
}

if (obj != null) {
    context.unbind("java:comp/env/myObject");
}
```

## Conclusion: A Path to Robust Java Applications

Understanding and handling potential exceptions like `IllegalUnbindException` is vital in crafting robust Java applications. By implementing defensive checks and adhering to best practices, your Java program will not only be more resilient but also easier to debug and maintain. 

With this guide, you should now be well-equipped to tackle `IllegalUnbindException` if ever you stumble upon it in your Java journey. Remember: an exception is not an error, but a condition that your program can and should prepare for. Keep calm and happy coding!
