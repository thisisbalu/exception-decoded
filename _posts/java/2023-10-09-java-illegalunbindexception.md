Java is a robust programming language notable for its platform independence and robustness. With a seemingly relentless proliferation of classes and interfaces, it is laced with a plethora of checked and unchecked exceptions. Today, we will explore one rarely discussed but nonetheless essential exception - the `IllegalUnbindException`. 

Despite your programming prowess, it is quite probable that you might have never encountered this exception. You'll mostly encounter the `IllegalUnbindException` when dealing with remote object bindings and unbindings with the Java's Remote Method Invocation (RMI). So let's delve into understanding and handling this intriguing exception.

## Exploring the Exception: IllegalUnbindException

The `IllegalUnbindException` is a checked exception that belongs to the `java.rmi` package. It's part of Java's Remote Method Invocation (RMI) mechanism and is thrown by `UnicastRemoteObject` or `Activatable` unbind methods when trying to unbind a name that has no active binding in the RMI registry.

Classes inheriting from `RemoteServer` or `Activatable` can bind and unbind their remote objects using the `bind()` method and the `unbind()` method respectively: 

```java
String name = "server";
Server server = new ServerImplementer();
Registry registry = LocateRegistry.getRegistry();

// Binding the remote object (server) in the RMI registry
registry.bind(name, server);

// Unbinding the remote object (server) from the RMI registry
registry.unbind(name);
```

In this example, if there are no bindings in the RMI registry under the name 'server', the `IllegalUnbindException` will be thrown when we try to forcibly unbind the non-existent binding.

The `IllegalUnbindException` in Java extends the `java.rmi.RemoteException`. The class hierarchy can be presented as follows:
```
Throwable -> Exception -> RemoteException -> IllegalUnbindException
```

## Decoding IllegalUnbindException

Lets run a simple program to better understand how this exception is thrown. 

```java
import java.rmi.*;
import java.rmi.registry.*;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            String name = "unboundName";
            Registry registry = LocateRegistry.getRegistry();
            registry.unbind(name);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

Executing the above code when there are no bindings in the RMI registry under the name 'unboundName' should print out an `IllegalUnbindException` stack trace.

## Exception's Solutions and Best Practices

Now that we've seen how the `IllegalUnbindException` comes into play, it's important to note how we can prevent it and handle it effectively.

Before attempting to unbind a remote object, it's prudent to verify that the name/value pair indeed exists in the RMI registry. We can do this by invoking the `Registry.list()` method to fetch all the names bound in the registry, and then checking if our desired name is present among them. Here's an example:

```java
String name = "unboundName";
Registry registry = LocateRegistry.getRegistry();
String[] boundNames = registry.list();
boolean exists = Arrays.asList(boundNames).contains(name);

if (exists) {
    registry.unbind(name);
} else {
    System.out.println("Name not found in registry, not attempting to unbind.");
}
```

At this point, our `IllegalUnbindException` should be history.

## Wrapping Up

We have unearthed the causes, functionality, examples, and practices of the `IllegalUnbindException`. Our voyage may have been challenging, but it was well worth the effort. These experiences and learnings will bridge your comprehension gap, helping you become a versatile, better Java developer.
