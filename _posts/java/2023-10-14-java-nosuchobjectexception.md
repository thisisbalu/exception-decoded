In the heartland of Java programming lies the concept of exceptions, and in today's discourse, we focus on one prominent member of that family: `NoSuchObjectException`. As a frequently encountered exception, understanding this feature's workings significantly aids in improving codes' resilience and reliability. 

Like a missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle, the `NoSuchObjectException` undoubtedly creates a mayhem of its own. This article will demystify it, undrape its traits and even shed some light on how to handle it.

## Unveiling NoSuchObjectException: Definition and Where is it Used?

Let's begin by asking the most fundamental question: What is a `NoSuchObjectException` in Java? 

A sub-class of `java.rmi.RemoteException`, `NoSuchObjectException` is thrown when a particular RMI (Remote Method Invocation) target, previously exported into the RMI runtime, is no longer available. Consequently, it can be utilized in numerous scenarios where these conditions surface. A few examples would be un-exporting a remote object, executing the remote object’s `unreferenced` method or forcing garbage collection of the remote object.

```java
try {
    someRemoteMethod();
} catch (NoSuchObjectException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

## Basic Mechanisms: When and Why Does NoSuchObjectException Occur?

Simply put, `NoSuchObjectException` springs up when an attempted access is made to an unexistent object referenced via the RMI (Remote Method Invocation). 

In other words, `NoSuchObjectException` is generally thrown when:
- An exported remote object is manually unexported, 
- The `unreferenced` method of an exported remote object is initiated, 
- A remote object has been garbage collected.

Here’s an illustrative analogy: Consider you have booked a meeting with a colleague at a specific time. However, when you arrive for the meeting, you find that your colleague has left, making participation impossible. A similar scenario takes shape in Java when an attempt to access a no-longer-available object is made, resulting in a `NoSuchObjectException`.

## Evading NoSuchObjectException: Exception Handling in Java

Like exploring every nook and cranny of a maze, understanding the handling mechanism of exceptions in Java is equally intricate. But worry not! This section will address this complicated question in a fairly simplified and practical manner, focusing primarily on our concerned exception: `NoSuchObjectException`.

`NoSuchObjectException`, like any other Java exception, uses a classic try-catch mechanism for handling. Let’s observe how we can handle it in a code snippet below:

```java
try {
    UnicastRemoteObject.unexportObject(remoteObj, force);
} catch (NoSuchObjectException e) {
    // Log error
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

This basic exception handling method, though serving as a vital tool to prevent abrupt program termination, is far from ideal. In a practical application, it's essential to hold a solid strategy when catching exceptions. This might encompass logging the exception, taking corrective measures, or providing fallbacks. 

Here's a slightly enhanced version of the previous code snippet:

```java
try {
    UnicastRemoteObject.unexportObject(remoteObj, force);
} catch (NoSuchObjectException e) {
    // Log error
    logger.log(Level.WARNING, "Attempted to unexport a nonexistent RMI object: ", e);
     
    // Take corrective measures or provide fallbacks based on your application's context.
}
```

We logging the exception here, which helps to identify and fix the issue, thus highlighting that the best strategy in catching exceptions varies from case to case.

The journey of understanding Java's `NoSuchObjectException` alone can be quite an enthralling one. Delving into the remote method invocation in Java and the exceptions associated with it helps developers architect their applications efficiently and in a more resilient way. Java exceptions like `NoSuchObjectException` also embody a key principle of Object-Oriented Programming: letting the system handle errors gracefully, preventing unwanted crashes & ensuring a smooth user experience.

In conclusion, remember that mastering exceptions in Java, including `NoSuchObjectException`, stands as one of the latest milestones in your journey as an experienced Java developer. Keep practicing and digging into Java's inner mechanisms to weather all programming storms confidently.

Good luck in your future Java endeavours!
