Java is a versatile and robust programming language, characterized by its ability to handle a variety of tasks with relative ease. Threading, in particular, is one aspect of Java programming that allows multiple processes to run concurrently within a single program. However, this feature is not without its challenges. One commonly faced obstacle among Java programmers dealing with threading, is the `BrokenBarrierException`. 

In this comprehensive guide, we will demystify the BrokenBarrierException, taking you step-by-step towards a deeper understanding of what causes it, how to handle it, and the best practices surrounding it. 

## Understanding the Concept Behind BrokenBarrierException

To begin with, we need to clarify that a `BrokenBarrierException` is a type of [RuntimeException](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/RuntimeException.html) in Java. It falls under the class `java.util.concurrent`, which means it is thrown in circumstances related to concurrent programming, particularly when working with the CyclicBarrier class. 

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier;
import java.util.concurrent.BrokenBarrierException;
``` 

[CyclicBarrier](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CyclicBarrier.html) is a synchronization mechanism that allows threads to wait for each other at a predefined execution point (the barrier). When one of the threads reaches this barrier, it calls `await()`, causing it to bloc​k until all the other threads have reached the barrier.

Herein lay the seeds for our `BrokenBarrierException`. If, while a thread is waiting at the barrier, the barrier gets 'broken' due to interruption or timeout, this exception is thrown.

Let's illustrate this with a simple code:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier;
import java.util.concurrent.BrokenBarrierException;

// Creating a barrier for two threads
CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(2);

// Creating thread 1
Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
    try {
        System.out.println("Thread 1 waiting at barrier");
        barrier.await();
    } catch (InterruptedException | BrokenBarrierException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
});
  
thread1.start();
  
// Creating thread 2
Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
    try {
        System.out.println("Thread 2 waiting at barrier");
        barrier.await();
    } catch (InterruptedException | BrokenBarrierException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
});  
  
thread2.start();

// Calling reset method to break the barrier
barrier.reset();

```
In the above example, we've created a CyclicBarrier for two threads. Each thread waits at the barrier by calling `barrier.await()`. However, when the `barrier.reset()` is called, it breaks the waiting of threads and throws the `BrokenBarrierException`. 

## Handling BrokenBarrierException 

Since the BrokenBarrierException is a RuntimeException, it isn't required to catch it. However, as good practice, it is advisable to handle this exception within your concurrent programming tasks to ensure the smooth running of your threads and to avoid unexpected issues.

```java
try {
    barrier.await();
} catch (InterruptedException | BrokenBarrierException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
In our handling code above, we use a try-catch block to catch the `BrokenBarrierException` along with the `InterruptedException`. This is to ensure that our threads run smoothly even when faced with issues breaking the barrier.

## Best Practices

While working with threads and barriers, keep these best practices in mind:

* Ensure that you handle time-outs appropriately. If the barrier isn’t reached within a specified time limit, an exception will be thrown.
* Always handle `BrokenBarrierException` and `InterruptedException` in your code to ensure your threads continue running smoothly.
* Adjust the barrier's count with caution. Changing the barrier count incorrectly can lead to barrier breaks and subsequent `BrokenBarrierException`.
* Use the CyclicBarrier's `isBroken()` method to check the state of the barrier and take necessary action.
  
In wrapping up this discussion on Java's `BrokenBarrierException`, understanding the concepts of concurrent programming, the role of CyclicBarrier class, and most importantly, how to adeptly apply this knowledge can greatly enhance your proficiency in Java programming.

For complete details about `BrokenBarrierException`, refer to [Java official documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/BrokenBarrierException.html).

Remember, Exception handling is not just about fixing errors, but also about creating robust applications that can withstand unexpected turns and continue functioning smoothly.

Happy coding!
