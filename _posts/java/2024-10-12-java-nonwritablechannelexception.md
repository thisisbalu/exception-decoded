## Definition
In the realm of programming, exceptions are commonplace and understanding them is crucial. One such exception that Java developers may come across is the **NonWritableChannelException**. This article aims to provide an in-depth understanding of this exception, discussing its causes and potential solutions.

## Understanding NonWritableChannelException
`NonWritableChannelException` is a subtype of the `IOException` class, which occurs when attempting to write data to a channel that is not writable.

Channels in Java NIO (New Input/Output) provide a means to read or write data from a source, such as a file or network connection. Each channel has a specific mode, either read-only or write-only. If an attempt is made to write data to a channel that is not writable, the `NonWritableChannelException` is thrown.

## Causes of NonWritableChannelException
There are several common causes of a `NonWritableChannelException`:

### 1. Opening a Read-only Channel
One potential cause is attempting to write to a channel that was opened in read-only mode. For example:

```java
FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream("example.txt");
FileChannel fileChannel = fileInputStream.getChannel();
fileChannel.write(buffer); // NonWritableChannelException thrown
```

In the above code snippet, `FileInputStream` is used to create a read-only channel to a file. When the `write()` method is subsequently called on the channel, the `NonWritableChannelException` will be thrown.

### 2. Using an OutputStream on a Channel
Another cause of `NonWritableChannelException` is mistakenly using an `OutputStream` when working with a channel. The `OutputStream` class is part of Java I/O (Input/Output), whereas channels belong to Java NIO.

```java
FileChannel fileChannel = new FileOutputStream("output.txt").getChannel();
OutputStream outputStream = Channels.newOutputStream(fileChannel);
outputStream.write(bytes); // NonWritableChannelException thrown
```

In the above example, the `newOutputStream()` method is used to create an `OutputStream` from the `FileChannel`. When attempting to write data using the `write()` method of the `OutputStream`, the `NonWritableChannelException` will be thrown.

### 3. Using a Channel without Mapping it to a Writable File
A third cause of the `NonWritableChannelException` can occur when attempting to write to a channel that is not mapped to a writable file.

```java
FileTypeDetector fileTypeDetector = new MyFileTypeDetector();
Path path = Path.of("example.dat");
FileChannel fileChannel = FileChannel.open(path, StandardOpenOption.READ);
fileChannel.write(buffer); // NonWritableChannelException thrown
```

In this example, `FileChannel.open()` is used to open a file channel in read-only mode. When the `write()` method is called on this channel, it will throw the `NonWritableChannelException` as it is not mapped to a writable file.

## How to Handle NonWritableChannelException
Understanding the causes of `NonWritableChannelException` allows developers to handle it appropriately.

### 1. Check the Channel's Writability
Before writing data to a channel, it is vital to confirm that the channel is writable. We can use the `isOpen()` and `isWritable()` methods to validate the channel's state.

```java
if (fileChannel.isOpen() && fileChannel.isWritable()) {
   fileChannel.write(buffer);
} else {
   // Handle the non-writable channel appropriately
}
```

By performing these checks upfront, we can avoid the `NonWritableChannelException` and take appropriate action in case the channel is not writable.

### 2. Open Channel in Write Mode
To avoid the exception completely, ensure that you open the channel in write mode when a writable operation is required. 

```java
FileChannel fileChannel = new FileOutputStream("output.txt").getChannel();
fileChannel.write(buffer); // Successfully writes data to the channel
```

By opening the channel in write mode, any subsequent write operations on the channel will not trigger a `NonWritableChannelException`.

### 3. Handle the Exception Appropriately
When encountering a `NonWritableChannelException`, it is vital to handle it properly to prevent any unexpected behavior of your application. Depending on the context and requirements, you can choose to log an appropriate error message, alert the user, or take corrective action as necessary.

```java
try {
   fileChannel.write(buffer);
} catch (NonWritableChannelException e) {
   // Log or handle the exception appropriately
}
```

By catching and handling the exception, you can gracefully manage the exceptional scenario within your codebase.

## Conclusion
The `NonWritableChannelException` in Java is an IOException that occurs when attempting to write data to a channel that is not writable. By understanding the causes of this exception and implementing appropriate solutions, developers can prevent unexpected errors and build robust applications.

In this article, we explored the various causes of `NonWritableChannelException` and offered solutions to handle and avoid the exception, ensuring the smooth execution of your Java code.
