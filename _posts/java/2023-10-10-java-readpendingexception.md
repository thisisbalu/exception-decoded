In the vast realm of Java programming, you might often encounter different exceptions that tend to halt your coding progress. So, welcome to our comprehensive article, where we will critically delve into the details surrounding the Java `ReadPendingException`. Our discourse will take you through this exception's mechanism, how it manifests, and most importantly, how to deal with it effectively. 

## What is the ReadPendingException in Java? 

The `ReadPendingException` originates from the java.nio.channels package and extends the IllegalStateException. This specific exception is typically thrown whenever a read operation is still pending while you're trying to initiate another.

```java
public class ReadPendingException
extends IllegalStateException
```
This is a "checked" exception type, hence it's mandatory to specify a catch or specify block it within your program. Otherwise, a compilation error would occur.

## How does it Occur?

Consider that you are trying to read data from an AsynchronousSocketChannel or AsynchronousServerSocketChannel which is already in the process of reading data. In such a scenario, the program will throw a `ReadPendingException`. Let's visualize this with an example:

```java
AsynchronousServerSocketChannel server = AsynchronousServerSocketChannel.open();
