*"Panic is highly contagious, especially in situations when nothing is known and everything is in flux." - Stephen King*

As Java developers, it's safe to say that we've almost all faced mystery exceptions that make this Stephen King quote resonate. One exception that could potentially spark panic is `ReadPendingException`. What is it? Why is it happening? How can we fix it? Breathe, folks! Let me guide you through the labyrinth of this particular exception and help you understand its behavior better.

## **Understanding ReadPendingException in Java**

`ReadPendingException` is a runtime exception thrown when a read operation is initiated while another read operation is still in progress, violating the rule that only one read operation is allowed at any time. This exception is part of the `java.nio.channels` package[^1^]. 

Now, let's jump onto the nitty-gritty of this exception.

```java
try {
  ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(100);
  future.channel.read(buffer);
  future.channel.read(buffer);
} catch (ReadPendingException e) {
  // Handle exception
}
```
If you look at the code above, `ReadPendingException` is thrown when the second read operation tries to start. This happens because the first operation is still not finished.

## **Exploring the Origin**

`ReadPendingException` is a relatively new addition in Java, introduced as part of `java.nio.channels.AsynchronousChannel` interface in Java 7 [^2^]. This interface provides asynchronous functionality to channels. 

## **Parts of ReadPendingException**

The `ReadPendingException` extends `IllegalStateException`, meaning it's a form of `RuntimeException`. `RuntimeException` is unchecked, meaning the Java compiler does not mandate that it be caught or declared in the `throws` clause of methods[^4^]. 

So, `ReadPendingException` is unchecked, and you won't know about it until it shows up at runtime.

```java
public class ReadPendingException
extends IllegalStateException
```

## **Avoiding ReadPendingException**

Reading from a channel should be sequential with one operation succeeding another. If we simply adjust our execution accordingly, it can work. For instance, we could set a status that gets checked before initiating a read operation.

```java
boolean isReading = false;

...

if(!isReading) {
  isReading = true;
  ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(100);
  future.channel.read(buffer);
} else {
    // Do something else or wait
}
```
This is a simple technique to prevent concurrent read operations and therefore `ReadPendingException`.

## **Handling ReadPendingException**

Exception handling is a key part of programming. If we cannot avoid an exception, we must be ready to handle it gracefully. A try-catch block is an efficient way to handle a `ReadPendingException`.

```java
try {
  ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(100);
  future.channel.read(buffer);
  future.channel.read(buffer);
} catch (ReadPendingException e) {
  System.err.println("Concurrent Reading: " +e);
}
```

In this example, the `catch` block will intercept the `ReadPendingException` and execute a print statement.

## **Conclusion**

In conclusion, `ReadPendingException` is not a monster lurking in your code but a helpful reminder to keep your read operations in order. Java allows us to handle these exceptions efficiently, minimizing the impact on our overall program.

As we continue to brave the waves of Java exceptions, always remember - every error is a lesson learned, and every exception handled is a step closer to mastering Java.
