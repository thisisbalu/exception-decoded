## Introduction
Welcome to our comprehensive guide on the `NoSuchMethodException` in Java - a popular exception encountered by developers when calling methods that don't exist at runtime. In this article, we will delve into the intricacies of this exception, explore its causes, showcase handling strategies, and provide code examples to facilitate a smooth debugging process.

## Overview of NoSuchMethodException 
The `NoSuchMethodException` is an unchecked exception in Java that indicates the attempted invocation of a method that does not exist within a specific class. This typically occurs due to discrepancies between the method name and/or signature during runtime, triggering the exception to be thrown.

## Causes of NoSuchMethodException 
The `NoSuchMethodException` can occur for various reasons:
- **Misspelled Method Name**: If the method name is spelled incorrectly during method call, the compiler does not identify the discrepancy, but the exception is thrown at runtime.
- **Incorrect Method Signature**: Mismatching parameters or their order during method invocation leads to this exception.
- **Incompatible Version**: Using a method that does not exist in the current version of the class or library can cause this exception to be thrown.

## Common Scenarios and Examples 
Let's explore some common scenarios where `NoSuchMethodException` can be encountered, accompanied by relevant code examples.

#### Scenario 1: Misspelled Method Name
```java
public class MyClass {
    public void doSomething() {
        // Code implementation
    }
}

// Method call with spelling mistake
MyClass instance = new MyClass();
instance.doSometing(); // NoSuchMethodException
```

#### Scenario 2: Incorrect Method Signature
```java
public class MyClass {
    public void process(String name) {
        // Code implementation
    }
}

// Method call with incorrect parameter type
MyClass instance = new MyClass();
instance.process(42); // NoSuchMethodException
```

#### Scenario 3: Incompatible Version
```java
// Code using method introduced in JDK 8
Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("key", 42);
map.getOrDefault("key", 0); // NoSuchMethodException if running JDK versions prior to 8
```

## Handling NoSuchMethodException
Once encountered, the `NoSuchMethodException` should be addressed using proper handling techniques. In this section, we will discuss three key strategies for effectively managing this exception.

#### Checking Method Existence 
Before invoking a method, it is advisable to check its existence within the class using the `getDeclaredMethod()` or `getDeclaredMethods()` methods from the `Class` class.
```java
public class MyClass {
    public void doSomething() {
        // Code implementation
    }
}

MyClass instance = new MyClass();
try {
    Method method = instance.getClass().getDeclaredMethod("doSomething");
    method.invoke(instance);
} catch (NoSuchMethodException | IllegalAccessException | InvocationTargetException e) {
    // Handle exception
}
```

#### Method Overloading 
Method overloading can lead to ambiguities, potentially resulting in the `NoSuchMethodException`. Use explicit casting to avoid any confusion during method invocation.
```java
public class MyClass {
    public void process(int number) {
        // Code implementation for integer
    }

    public void process(double number) {
        // Code implementation for double
    }
}

MyClass instance = new MyClass();
double value = 3.14;
instance.process((int) value);
```

#### Version Compatibility 
When using external libraries or frameworks, verifying version compatibility is crucial. Ensure the correct version is employed to avoid `NoSuchMethodException` caused by missing methods.
```java
// Code specific to JDK 8
Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("key", 42);
map.getOrDefault("key", 0); // NoSuchMethodException if running JDK versions prior to 8
```

## Best Practices
To handle the `NoSuchMethodException` effectively, keep these best practices in mind:
- **Revisit Method Signatures**: Check for any mismatches between method names and signatures.
- **Thorough Code Review**: Perform a comprehensive review to identify any misspelled method calls before runtime.
- **Regular Testing**: Regularly test code components that depend on external libraries or frameworks to validate method compatibility.
- **Upgrade JDK as Required**: Keep up with JDK updates to ensure method availability.

## Conclusion
The `NoSuchMethodException` in Java is an exception usually encountered when calling methods that do not exist at runtime. By closely examining the causes, using try-catch blocks, and handling the exception as demonstrated, developers can effectively debug and address this exception. Additionally, adopting best practices such as thorough code reviews and regular testing contributes to the prevention and timely resolution of `NoSuchMethodException` scenarios.

We hope you found this guide insightful and that it aids you in successfully navigating the intricacies of the `NoSuchMethodException` in Java!
