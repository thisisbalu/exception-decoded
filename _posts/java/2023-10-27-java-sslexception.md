Java is a popular, object-oriented, class-based program language that is designed to be as executable as possible across several platforms. One of the issues a Java developer may encounter is an `SSLException`. This article will cover everything â€“ from defining what it is, why it occurs, how to diagnose and debug it, and also include some illustrative Java code examples. So whether you're a beginner or seasoned professional, this guide can assist you.

## What is SSLException in Java?

`SSLException` is a generalized exception that occurs when a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol error occurs. This error could surface for numerous reasons, such as an application trying to use SSL and the SSL implementation returning an error, or a failed handshake request with servers.

SSL is a security protocol that provides secure communication over the internet. It ensures that data transmitted between two points remains encrypted and secure, preventing any third parties from intercepting or tampering with the data.

When using the java programming language, the SSLException is part of Java's javax.net.ssl package and is usually thrown due to an issue with the SSL configuration. Let's deep dive into some of the common causes that trigger this Exception.

```java
try {
    // Code that can potentially throw an SSLException
} catch (SSLException e) {
    // Handle SSLException
}
```

## Diagnosing the SSLException

There are a few reasons you might encounter an `SSLException`. Here are a few scenarios:

1. **Mismatched protocol version**: If the server's SSL/TLS protocol version is different to that of the client's, the SSLException may occur. 

2. **Invalid SSL certificate**: If the SSL certificate is either expired, not yet valid, or not trusted, an SSLException could be thrown. 

3. **SSL handshake failure**: The SSL handshake is a process where the client and server validate each other and establish encryption algorithms they'll use for the communication. If this fails, an SSLException is thrown. 

Uncovering the root cause begins with diagnosing the stack trace, error message, and the circumstances under which the exception occurred.

## Debugging the SSLException

There are different strategies to debug `SSLException`. We will go through some of the most common methods.

* **Debug SSL Traffic**: Java includes an option to debug SSL traffic using the `-Djavax.net.debug` system property. Setting this option provides detailed output of each SSL record that traverses the JVM.

```bash
java -Djavax.net.debug=all YourApplication
```

* **Checking Certificate Validity**: Always verify if your certificate is valid, not expired, and issued from a trusted certificate authority.

```java
public boolean isCertificateExpired(Certificate certificate) {
    Date currentDate = new Date();
    try {
        ((X509Certificate) certificate).checkValidity(currentDate);
        return false;
    } catch (CertificateExpiredException e) {
        return true;
    } catch (CertificateNotYetValidException e) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

* **Check SSL Protocol Compatibility**: Always ensure that the client and server are running compatible versions of SSL/TLS. If you have control over the server's protocol configuration, it might need matching with the client.

## Handling SSLException

Here is a simple and concise way of handling SSL exceptions:

```java
try {
    // Code that will potentially thrown an SSLException
} catch(SSLException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();  // Prints detailed information of the exception
}
```

## Conclusion

Encountering an `SSLException` in Java can be daunting. However, armed with an understanding of its causes and equipped with diagnostic and debug methods, you can manage and resolve these issues efficiently.

Remember, if you want to secure your application, SSL is crucial. Debugging SSL issues might occasionally seem like a challenge, but it's an integral part of maintaining the security your users trust you to provide.
