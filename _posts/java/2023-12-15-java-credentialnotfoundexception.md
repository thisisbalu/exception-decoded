## 1. What is CredentialNotFoundException?

The **CredentialNotFoundException** is a type of exception that occurs when a required credential cannot be found or accessed. Credentials can include a username, password, API key, or any other form of authentication token required for secured access to systems, APIs, or databases.

In Java, this exception belongs to the `javax.security.auth.login` package and is part of the Java SE Platform. It extends the `LoginException`, which is a checked exception. Therefore, any method that throws a `CredentialNotFoundException` should declare it using the `throws` keyword.

## 2. Causes of CredentialNotFoundException

The **CredentialNotFoundException** can be thrown in several scenarios. Let's explore a few common causes:

### 2.1. Invalid or Missing Credentials

One of the common reasons for a `CredentialNotFoundException` is when the supplied credentials are invalid or missing. This might occur when attempting to authenticate a user with incorrect login credentials.

```java
import javax.security.auth.login.CredentialNotFoundException;

public class UserAuthentication {
   public void authenticateUser(String username, String password) throws CredentialNotFoundException {
       // Code to validate username and password
       if (!isValidUser(username, password)) {
           throw new CredentialNotFoundException("Invalid username or password");
       }
   }

   private boolean isValidUser(String username, String password) {
       // Code to validate user credentials
       // ...
   }
}
```

In the above example, the `authenticateUser` method throws a `CredentialNotFoundException` if the provided username and password fail the validation process.

### 2.2. Unavailability of Required Credentials

Another cause might be the unavailability of required credentials at runtime. This can happen when a system or service you are trying to access requires certain credentials that are not available in the expected location.

```java
import javax.security.auth.login.CredentialNotFoundException;

public class APIService {
   public void callAPI(String apiUrl, String apiKey) throws CredentialNotFoundException {
       // Check if apiKey is null or empty
       if (apiKey == null || apiKey.isEmpty()) {
           throw new CredentialNotFoundException("API key not found");
       }
       // Code to call the API
   }
}
```

In this example, the `callAPI` method throws a `CredentialNotFoundException` if the API key is not provided.

## 3. Handling CredentialNotFoundException

When dealing with a `CredentialNotFoundException`, proper handling is crucial to prevent unexpected behavior in our Java application. Let's explore a couple of approaches for handling this exception.

### 3.1. Try-Catch Block

One of the most common ways to handle exceptions is by using a `try-catch` block. We can catch the `CredentialNotFoundException` and handle it accordingly.

```java
try {
    // Code that may throw CredentialNotFoundException
} catch (CredentialNotFoundException e) {
    // Handle the exception: log, display an error message, or perform alternative actions.
}
```

By using a `try-catch` block, we can gracefully handle the exception and take appropriate actions, such as displaying error messages, logging, or initiating fallback mechanisms in our code.

### 3.2. Using Optional

Another approach is to use the `Optional` class, introduced in Java 8, to handle the absence of a credential in a streamlined and concise manner.

```java
import javax.security.auth.login.CredentialNotFoundException;
import java.util.Optional;

public class CredentialService {
    public Optional<String> getApiKey() {
        // Code to retrieve apiKey
        // Return Optional.empty() if apiKey is not available
    }

    public void processRequest() throws CredentialNotFoundException {
        String apiKey = getApiKey().orElseThrow(() -> new CredentialNotFoundException("API key not found"));
        // Code to process the request using the apiKey
    }
}
```

In the example above, the `getApiKey` method returns an `Optional<String>`. We can then use the `orElseThrow` method to throw a `CredentialNotFoundException` if the `Optional` object is empty.

## 4. Best Practices to Avoid CredentialNotFoundException

To minimize the occurrence of a `CredentialNotFoundException` in your code, here are some best practices to follow:

- Ensure proper validation of user input before attempting to authenticate.
- Implement robust error handling mechanisms, such as `try-catch` blocks, to gracefully handle exceptions.
- Keep credentials in secure locations and avoid hardcoding them in the source code.
- Regularly update and rotate credentials for enhanced security.
- Use secure credential management tools or frameworks for managing and accessing credentials.

## 5. Conclusion

In this article, we explored the **CredentialNotFoundException** in Java, learning about its definition, possible causes, and effective ways to handle it. By understanding and handling this exception properly, developers can ensure smoother execution of their Java applications, enhancing the overall reliability and security.

Remember, error handling and exception management are vital components of code development. By adopting best practices and implementing robust error handling mechanisms, we can build resilient and reliable software systems.
