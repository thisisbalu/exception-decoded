JAVA, as a robust high-level object-oriented programming language, provides a rich library for programmers to work with. One such library is the java.nio (New Input/Output) that provides functionalities for non-blocking IO operations. An aspect of this library that we'll deep-dive into today is the OverlappingFileLockException.

## The What: Understanding OverlappingFileLockException

The `OverlappingFileLockException` is a checked exception that occurs when a program tries to acquire a lock on a file that overlaps with an existing lock by the same Java virtual machine (JVM) or thread, hence the name 'overlapping.'

The exception is part of the `java.nio.channels` package and inherits from the `java.io.IOException`.

An example of such a situation might look like this:

```java
RandomAccessFile stream = new RandomAccessFile("example.txt", "rw");
FileChannel channel = stream.getChannel();
FileLock lock1 = channel.tryLock();
FileLock lock2 = channel.tryLock();
```

In the example above, the second `tryLock()` method call would throw an `OverlappingFileLockException` because there is already a lock obtained by the same JVM or thread.

## The Why: causes of OverlappingFileLockException

An `OverlappingFileLockException` occurs primarily when two conditions are simultaneously met:

1. A FileChannel is attempting to lock a specific region of a file, and,
2. The same JVM or thread has already locked that exact region or a part of it.

The attempt could be via the `tryLock()` or `lock()` methods, both of which attempt to obtain a lock on a specific region of the file, or the entire file. If the region overlaps with an existing lock from the same JVM or thread, the OverlappingFileLockException is thrown.

This exception prevents an application from running into a deadlock situation. A deadlock could occur if multiple threads within the same JVM attempt to acquire locks that overlap each other.

## The How: Resolving OverlappingFileLockException

Avoiding an `OverlappingFileLockException` requires good coding practices and strategies that avoid overlapping locks within the same JVM or thread. Here are a few methods to achieve this:

### 1. Use an exclusive locking mechanism:

In this scenario, use different JVMs or threads to acquire a lock on different parts of the file, ensuring there's no overlap.

```java
RandomAccessFile stream = new RandomAccessFile("example.txt", "rw");
FileChannel channel = stream.getChannel();
FileLock lock1 = channel.tryLock(0, 10, false);
FileLock lock2 = channel.tryLock(10, 20, false);
```

### 2. Release a lock before acquiring another:

Before acquiring the second lock, ensure that the first lock is released.

```java
RandomAccessFile stream = new RandomAccessFile("example.txt", "rw");
FileChannel channel = stream.getChannel();
FileLock lock1 = channel.tryLock();
lock1.release();
FileLock lock2 = channel.tryLock();
```

### 3. Use careful exception handling:

Wrap all file locking attempts within a `try-catch` block. If `OverlappingFileLockException` is caught, handle it by releasing the previous lock or skipping the current locking attempt.

```java
RandomAccessFile stream = new RandomAccessFile("example.txt", "rw");
FileChannel channel = stream.getChannel();
FileLock lock1 = channel.tryLock();

try {
    FileLock lock2 = channel.tryLock();
} catch (OverlappingFileLockException e) {
    // Handle the exception accordingly
}
```

In conclusion, the error handling of Java programming greatly improves the performance and reliability of your applications and is a crucial skill for every developer. Understanding the OverlappingFileLockException is an important part of this skillset and can help you write more robust and error-free code.

The OverlappingFileLockException can be a roadblock for any developer, but as we've seen, understanding it and knowing how to navigate it effectively can save you a headache. Happy coding!
