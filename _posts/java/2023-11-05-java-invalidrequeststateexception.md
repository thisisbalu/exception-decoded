Java is undeniably a widely-acclaimed and versatile programming language. Known for its robustness, it's a go-to choice for many developers. However, like any other programming language, troubleshooting Java can sometimes be a little tricky. Today, we are addressing an infrequent, yet a significant exception that occurs in Java, the `InvalidRequestStateException.`

## What is InvalidRequestStateException in Java? 

InvalidRequestStateException is a subclass of the `ImsException` class and represents an exception for an invalid request state. In short, it primarily occurs whenever a request is made in an inappropriate state. In a server programming context, this could be caused by various scenarios, such as trying to access a session parameter after a session has been invalidated or trying to write to an output stream after the response has been committed.

```java
public class InvalidRequestStateException extends ImsException {
    //......
}
```

## Understanding InvalidRequestStateException

Understanding the reasons behind the `InvalidRequestStateException` is vital to prevent it. Generally, the main reason happens to be calling methods after a session has been invalidated. Furthermore, it could also occur due to forwarding or redirecting a response after the output stream has committed data to it.

Let's consider an example to better illustrate the issues:

```java
protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
        throws ServletException, IOException {
    PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
    out.print("Hello World!");
    out.flush();
    RequestDispatcher rd=request.getRequestDispatcher("/welcome.jsp");  
    rd.forward(request, response);
}
```

In this case, `InvalidRequestStateException` will be thrown because the servlet attempts to forward to a `JSP` after already writing to the output stream. 

But why does an `InvalidRequestStateException` occur in these situations? Well, the forward method clears buffer and sets a new content, but when content has already been committed, buffer clearing and resetting new content is impossible, hence the exception.

## Solutions to Prevent InvalidRequestStateException 

1. **Not committing the response before forwarding or redirecting**. One of the most advantageous ways to resolve the `InvalidRequestStateException` is by making sure that the servlet or JSP does not commit the response before a forward or redirect:

```java
protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
        throws ServletException, IOException {
    RequestDispatcher rd=request.getRequestDispatcher("/welcome.jsp");  
    rd.forward(request, response);
}
```

2. **Not performing any operation after session invalidation**. It is crucial to avoid executing any operation after session invalidation as it might lead to an `InvalidRequestStateException`.

```java
protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
        throws ServletException, IOException {
    HttpSession session=request.getSession(false);  
    if(session!=null){  
        session.invalidate();
    }  
    // Avoid operations with invalidated session.
}
```

3. **Try/Catch**: It's also beneficial to use Java's Try/Catch block. 

```java
try {
    // Your code here
} catch (InvalidRequestStateException e) {
    // Exception handling
}
```

In essence, by paying heed to the lifecycle of HTTP interaction and proper exception handling, we can mitigate the `InvalidRequestStateException`. 

## Conclusion

The `InvalidRequestStateException` in Java is not a general but a technical exception that can stop you dead in your tracks. Understanding Java requests, responses, and session states are fundamental to swerve away from this exception. The solutions outlined in this blog post are succinct, clear-cut ways to help you prevent an `InvalidRequestStateException` from happening.
