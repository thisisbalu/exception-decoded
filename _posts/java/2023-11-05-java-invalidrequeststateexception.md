## Introduction

When working with Java, it's not uncommon to come across the `InvalidRequestStateException` error. So what exactly is this exception, and how can you resolve it? This tutorial gives you the inside scoop on this exception, where it usually pops up, and concrete solutions to combat it.

## Origins of InvalidRequestStateException

The `InvalidRequestStateException` is a type of `IllegalStateException`. It is thrown when a method has been invoked at an improper time, and the Java runtime system does not have the necessary state for executing the underlying code.   

## Common Causes of the InvalidRequestStateException

Understanding the origins of this exception is the first step to resolving it. Essentially, the `InvalidRequestStateException` primarily surfaces when asynchronous operations are going on in your application, and parallel actions interfere with each other. Let's dive into some typical situations:

### 1. Interrupted Asynchronous Processing

In a generalized scenario, you would encounter an `InvalidRequestStateException` when a server-side component tries to interact with a client while there is an ongoing asynchronous processing operation. 

Consider the following code sample:

```java
@RequestMapping(value = "/asyncProcessing", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public Callable<String> asyncProcessing() {
    return new Callable<String>() {
        @Override
        public String call() throws InterruptedException {
            Thread.sleep(5000);
            return "<h1>Completed</h1>";
        }
    };
}
```

If you try to interact with the deployed server before the `asyncProcessing` method completes, you would trigger the `InvalidRequestStateException`.

### 2. Pre-emptive Thread Interruption

A premature interruption of a thread can also cause this unwelcomed exception. 

```java
Thread t = new Thread(new Runnable() {
    public void run() {
       // Insert long running computation
    } 
});

t.start();

try {
    t.interrupt();
} catch (InvalidRequestStateException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

If `t.interrupt()` gets called prematurely, it would lead to the `InvalidRequestStateException`.

## How to Resolve the InvalidRequestStateException

Once you're acquainted with the leading causes of `InvalidRequestStateException`, it's easier to devise countermeasures.

### 1. Ensuring Sequential Processing

This is a two-fold solution where you can try to ensure that your asynchronous processing operates sequentially. 

Make sure your application isn't trying to process new requests before the preceding processing tasks have been executed fully. 

### 2. Avoiding Pre-emptive Thread Interruptions

Make it a point to allow the threads executing your method to complete their execution before interrupting them.

```java
Thread t = new Thread(new Runnable() {
    public void run() {
       // Insert long running computation here
    } 
});

t.start();

try {
    t.join();
    t.interrupt();
} catch (InvalidRequestStateException | InterruptedException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
We've used `t.join()` to ensure that our main program waits for `t` to finish before invoking `t.interrupt()`.

## Conclusion

Coming across an `InvalidRequestStateException` can seem daunting but when taken apart, you realize the solutions are relatively simple and primarily involve allowing specific processes to complete before invoking any new actions. 

It's integral to scrutinize your Java code and ensure that asynchronous operations are being correctly handled. Understanding and applying these strategies will help you create better, more robust applications that can handle different types of requests and processes seamlessly.
