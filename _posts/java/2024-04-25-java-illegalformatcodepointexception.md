**Introduction**

Java is a widely used programming language known for its robustness and versatility. However, when dealing with text and character encoding, developers may encounter an exception called `IllegalFormatCodePointException`. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore this exception in detail, understand its causes, and learn how to handle it effectively in your Java code. So let's dive right in!

**1. Overview**

Java provides a rich set of tools and libraries for handling and manipulating strings. However, text data often comes with various challenges, and one such challenge is dealing with invalid or illegal Unicode characters. The `IllegalFormatCodePointException` is thrown when formatting a string with a format specifier that references an illegal Unicode code point. This exception is a subclass of `IllegalFormatException`, which is thrown when the format of a textual representation is inappropriate.

---

**2. Understanding IllegalFormatCodePointException**

The `IllegalFormatCodePointException` is a runtime exception that occurs when a format specifier in string formatting refers to an invalid Unicode code point. It is most commonly encountered while using the `String.format()` method, where format specifiers are used to insert variable values into a formatted string.

For example, consider the following code snippet:

```java
String name = "John";
int age = 25;

String formattedString = String.format("Name: %s, Age: %d", name, age);
```

In this case, if the `name` variable contains a string with an invalid Unicode code point, such as an unpaired surrogate or an out-of-range code point, an `IllegalFormatCodePointException` will be thrown.

---

**3. Causes of IllegalFormatCodePointException**

There are several scenarios that can lead to the occurrence of an `IllegalFormatCodePointException`. Here are some common causes:

- **Unpaired Surrogates**: When a surrogate pair is not properly formed or combined, resulting in an unpaired surrogate, this exception may be thrown. Surrogates are used in UTF-16 encoding to represent Unicode code points outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP).

- **Out-of-Range Code Points**: Unicode defines a range of code points that are valid. If a code point falls outside this range, an `IllegalFormatCodePointException` will occur. For example, a code point greater than U+10FFFF or a negative code point is considered invalid.

---

**4. Identifying Illegal Code Points**

To effectively handle `IllegalFormatCodePointException`, it is crucial to identify the specific code points causing the issue. This can be done using the `Character.isValidCodePoint(int codePoint)` method. Here's an example:

```java
String input = "Some text with an invalid character: \uD83G\uDE02!";
int invalidCodePointIndex = -1;

for (int i = 0; i < input.length(); i++) {
    int codePoint = input.codePointAt(i);

    if (!Character.isValidCodePoint(codePoint)) {
        invalidCodePointIndex = i;
        break;
    }
}

// invalidCodePointIndex will hold the index of the first invalid code point
```

In this snippet, we iterate over each character in the input string and check if the code point is valid using the `isValidCodePoint()` method. If an invalid code point is found, we store the index for further actions.

**5. How to Handle IllegalFormatCodePointException**

Handling `IllegalFormatCodePointException` involves identifying the source of the error and applying appropriate corrective measures. Here are some strategies to consider:

- **Removing Invalid Code Points**: If invalid code points are identified, they can be eliminated from the string using the `Character.isHighSurrogate(char ch)` and `Character.isLowSurrogate(char ch)` methods. This way, only valid characters remain, preventing the exception from being thrown.

- **Replacing Invalid Code Points**: Alternatively, invalid code points can be replaced with valid ones or substituted with a placeholder character.

```java
String input = "Some text with an invalid character: \uD83G\uDE02!";
String sanitizedInput = input.replaceAll("[\\x00-\\x1F\\x7F-\\x9F]", "?");
```

In this example, the `replaceAll()` method is utilized to replace all control characters (including invalid code points) with a question mark character.

**6. Best Practices to Avoid IllegalFormatCodePointException**

To minimize the occurrence of `IllegalFormatCodePointException` in your Java applications, it is essential to follow some best practices:

- **Validate User Input**: When handling user input, perform appropriate validation to ensure it does not contain invalid code points. Regular expressions or libraries like Apache Commons Lang can help in this regard.

- **Use Charset Encoding**: When reading input from external sources or processing files, use the appropriate character encoding to prevent invalid code points from being introduced.

- **Handle Input Stream Characters**: When working with character streams, ensure any illegal code points are detected and handled gracefully.

---

**7. Conclusion**

The `IllegalFormatCodePointException` is an exception that arises when formatting a string containing illegal Unicode code points. By understanding the causes and possible solutions, you can effectively handle this exception in your Java code. Remember to validate user input, identify illegal code points, and apply necessary corrective measures. Following best practices for text handling will help you avoid this exception and ensure your applications handle text and Unicode elegantly.
