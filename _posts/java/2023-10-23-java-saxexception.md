At the heart of any solid Java program lies a well-handled exception. One of the common exceptions we come across in Java is `SAXException`. When working on XML parsers, `SAXException` has often made its way to our console. But what exactly is it, and how can we effectively handle it in our code? Read on to decode the `SAXException` in Java. 

## SAXException: What Is It? 

`SAXException` is a general-purpose exception class, stands for "Simple API for XML". It is intended to encapsulate any XML-related exception. The `SAXException` typically wraps another exception that prompted its creation. This exception may be obtained using the `getException` method. `SAXException` also includes a `getMessage()` method that returns a string representation of the error or warning, which is useful for debugging. This method may return an empty string or null if the specific syntax error or tag omission is unknown. 

Here is what a typical SAXException looks like:

```java
    try {
        // Code that may throw an exception
    } catch (SAXException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
```

## The Types of `SAXException`

Java `SAXExceptions` typically come in two main types: 

1. **ParseExceptions:** These are caused due to incorrect XML document structure. This may occur if, for example, a tag is not properly closed. 

2. **ValidationExceptions:** These are caused due to incorrect data in the XML document. For example, if you expect an integer but obtain a string, it would cause a ValidationException. 

## Handling `SAXException`

The best strategy to handle `SAXExceptions` is to have a good understanding of the XML structure you are working with. However, here are some standard ways of handling SAXException:

```java 
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (SAXException e) {
    System.err.println("Caught SAXException" + e.getMessage());
} 
```
In the above code, we print the error message from the `SAXException`. This gives us an idea of what went wrong. 

## A Practical Example 

Let's take a look at how SAXException can pop up in practical Java programming. 

Suppose we are using a SAX Parser to read an XML file. However, the XML is not correctly formatted. This can lead to SAXException. 

Below is our XML file `book.xml`:

```xml
<book>
    <title unclosedTag "The Lord of the Rings"/>
</book>
```
Now, when we try to parse this XML using SAXParser, it will throw a SAXException. Here is our Java code:

```java
import javax.xml.parsers.*;
import org.xml.sax.*;
import java.io.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            File inputFile = new File("book.xml");
            SAXParserFactory factory = SAXParserFactory.newInstance();
            SAXParser saxParser = factory.newSAXParser();
            UserHandler userhandler = new UserHandler();
            saxParser.parse(inputFile, userhandler);     
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
In this code, we see that our SAXParser is unable to parse the XML file due to the unclosed "title" tag, thereby throwing a SAXException.

## Conclusion 

Although handling exceptions can be tricky, a comprehensive understanding of how they function can save us from problematic bugs and make our code more robust. The `SAXException` is one of the Java XML related exceptions that, once understood and handled correctly, can make your journey with XML parsing a whole lot smoother.

Remember, the most poignant solution to bid farewell to `SAXException` is ensuring your XML files follow the correct structure and data format. Plus, make use of exception's message to debug it effectively.   Happy Coding!
