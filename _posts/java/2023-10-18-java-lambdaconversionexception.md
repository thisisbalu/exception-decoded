Java is a widely used and highly versatile programming language, known for its rich set of libraries, robust community support and intriguing features. One such feature is Lambda expressions introduced in Java 8. As software developers, we often come across various exceptions while coding and one such exception related to lambda expressions is `LambdaConversionException`. 

This article offers a deep dive into the `LambdaConversionException`, how it arises, and how we deal with it. We will be sharing numerous code snippets and illustrations to make your learning experience more engaging and enlightening.

## Lambda Conversion Exception: An Overview

Before proceeding, it is important to understand what a `LambdaConversionException` is. From Oracle's official Java docs:

> `LambdaConversionException` is an unchecked exception, used to indicate that the conversion of a lambda expression (or method reference) to a functional interface type (by method invocation conversion) cannot be done as according to the language's specification.

Simply put, `LambdaConversionException` arises when there is a failure in the conversion of a lambda expression or a method reference into a functional interface type. 

## Exploring Lambda Expressions

Lambda expressions can arguably be considered as one of the best features introduced in Java 8. They enable functional programming and simplify the syntax to a significant extent. 

Let's take a quick look at the structure of a lambda expression:
```
(parameters) -> expression 
```
Or
```
(parameters) -> { statements; }
```

Here's a simple example of Lambda expression:
```java
Interface MyInterface {
    void method(int x);
}

public class MyClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        MyInterface ref = (x) -> System.out.println(2 * x);
        ref.method(5);
    }
}
```
When run, this would print '10' on the console.

## Encountering LambdaConversionException

Now, let's create a scenario where `LambdaConversionException` arises. To understand this, let's modify the above 'MyInterface' definition and add an extra method:

```java
Interface MyInterface {
    boolean booleanMethod();
    void method(int x);
}
```
If we now run our class, we'll encounter the `LambdaConversionException`. The reason is Java's functional interfaces should contain exactly one abstract method, which isn't the case here.

## Fixing LambdaConversionException

The fix to the `LambdaConversionException` is pretty straightforward. Just make sure that the interface your lambda expression or method reference targets should be a functional interface i.e., it should contain exactly one abstract method. Here's the corrected version of the above problematic code:

```java
Interface MyInterface {
    void method(int x);
}

public class MyClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        MyInterface ref = (x) -> System.out.println(2 * x);
        ref.method(5);
    }
}
```
As you can see, I have returned the 'MyInterface' back to its original state with only one abstract method. 

## Wrapping Up

Java is a continuously evolving language that embraces changes and new features to improve coding efficiency. Working with Lambda expressions is quite fulfilling, but like everything else in programming, it's not free from exceptions. `LambdaConversionException` is one such irregularity developers face. But, with a clear understanding of its cause, we can address and resolve it with ease. 

Happy coding, and may your lambda expressions always be error-free!
