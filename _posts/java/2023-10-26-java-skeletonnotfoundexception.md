If you are a seasoned Java developer, you might have encountered a spooky exception called the `SkeletonNotFoundException`. If it pushes you into a quagmire of confusion, this blog post is exactly for you.

In the next 15 minutes, this article will take you on a journey to comprehend `SkeletonNotFoundException` in Java, providing you with a solid foundation to debug related issues efficiently.

## Prerequisites
Good understanding of Java, RMI (Remote Method Invocation), and Exception Handling in Java.

## Understanding the SkeletonNotFoundException

In Java remote method invocation (RMI), `SkeletonNotFoundException` is an exception which indicates that the Skeleton class, essential for a stub object to invoke a method on a remote object implementation, cannot be found.

```java
public class SkeletonNotFoundException
    extends java.rmi.RemoteException
```

A *Skeleton* in Java RMI is a helper class that facilitates the communication between a client-side stub and the actual server-side object.

## When does SkeletonNotFoundException occur?

A `SkeletonNotFoundException` breaks out when stub attempts to invoke a method on a remote object implementation, but the corresponding Skeleton class is not found. This might be due to:

- The skeleton class doesn't exist.
- The skeleton class cannot be loaded by the class loader.

## Java RMI: Stubs and Skeletons

To better understand the `SkeletonNotFoundException`, we first need to comprehend the part a skeleton plays in Java RMI. The RMI mechanism in Java uses stub and skeleton objects for interaction between client and server-side objects.

**_Stubs:_** A stub is a client-side proxy for the remote object. It is responsible for initiating the call to the remote service.

**_Skeletons:_** A skeleton is the server-side proxy that receives the client's call and forwards it to the server object.

The stub and skeleton classes are generated by the `rmic` compiler, which creates stub and skeleton classes for remote objects.

Before JDK 1.2, both stub and a skeleton were required for remote method invocation. However, the role of skeletons has been eliminated since the Skeleton Class can be generated at runtime.

## Handling SkeletonNotFoundException

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to handle this exception:

**Checking the naming and paths:** Ensure that all the files including the classes and interfaces are saved with correct naming conventions and in the correct directories.

**Checking the Classpath:** The JVM might not be finding your classes because they are not in the classpath. Ensure that the classpath is properly set in your environment.

**Regenerating the stubs and skeletons:** If you're using an older version of Java (`< JDK 1.2`), chances are you might need to regenerate the stubs and the skeletons using the `rmic` compiler.

```java
// Compiling the remote implementation class
javac RMIServerImpl.java

// Generating the stubs and skeletons
rmic RMIServerImpl
```

If you're using `>= JDK 1.2`, the stub class is enough; the skeleton classes are generated at runtime.

```java
// Compiling the remote implementation class
javac RMIServerImpl.java

// Generating the stubs
rmic -v1.2 RMIServerImpl
```
Remember, if you are using JDK 1.1, rmic generates both stub and skeleton by default.

## Best practices to avoid SkeletonNotFoundException:

**Migrate to newer versions:** In Java versions `>= JDK 1.2`, you donâ€™t require skeleton classes. If possible, migrate to newer versions of java to avoid this issue.

**Compatibility:** If you need to ensure that your server application is compatible with JDK 1.1 VMs, you can use `rmic -vcompat` to generate compatible stubs and skeletons.

## Conclusion

`SkeletonNotFoundException` might seem intimidating at first, especially if you're working with older versions of Java that require explicit Skeleton classes. However, understanding the RMI mechanism and the role of stubs and skeletons can help overcome this exception efficiently.

This article is the comprehensive guide to understand and resolve the `SkeletonNotFoundException`. With the basics covered and practical solutions provided, it's time to demystify this java exception!
