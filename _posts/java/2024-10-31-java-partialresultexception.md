## What is PartialResultException?

The `PartialResultException` is an exception class in Java that allows developers to handle partial results during the execution of a task. It is especially useful when dealing with scenarios where the entire result cannot be produced due to limitations, such as memory constraints, network issues, or time constraints.

When a `PartialResultException` is thrown, it indicates that a partial result has been generated and provides a mechanism for developers to retrieve the partial result for further processing or reporting. By leveraging `PartialResultException`, developers can avoid unnecessary failures and gracefully handle situations where partial results are acceptable.

<!-- Understanding Partial Results -->
## Understanding Partial Results

Before we delve deeper into `PartialResultException`, let's understand what exactly constitutes partial results. A partial result refers to a subset or an incomplete representation of the expected final result. For example, when processing a large dataset, it may not be feasible to load and process the entire dataset due to memory limitations. In such cases, processing a portion of the dataset and generating a partial result becomes necessary.

Partial results can be relevant not only in large data processing scenarios but also when retrieving data from multiple sources or when executing time-consuming tasks. By acknowledging and handling partial results, developers can ensure the overall progress of the application and provide meaningful feedback to the users.

## Handling Partial Results with PartialResultException

The `PartialResultException` class serves as a powerful tool to handle partial results with efficiency and ease. It allows developers to encapsulate the partial result within the exception, enabling downstream code to handle it appropriately. By catching `PartialResultException` and retrieving the encapsulated partial result, developers can implement custom logic to process, report, or even discard the partial result, depending on the application's requirements.

Using `PartialResultException` provides the following benefits:

1. **Flexibility**: By encapsulating partial results within an exception, developers can easily pass them to the appropriate handling code without disrupting the normal flow of execution.
2. **Precise Error Reporting**: `PartialResultException` enables applications to provide accurate information about the partial completion of a task, allowing users or administrators to make informed decisions.
3. **Debugging and Troubleshooting**: When encountering partial results, detailed information within the `PartialResultException` can help developers identify the underlying issues causing the partial completion and take appropriate actions accordingly.

Let's explore some code examples to better understand the practical implementation of `PartialResultException`.

<!-- Code Examples -->
## Code Examples

### Example 1: Processing a Large Dataset

Consider a scenario where you need to analyze a large dataset containing millions of records. Due to memory constraints, it is not feasible to load the entire dataset into memory at once; however, processing it in smaller chunks is achievable. Using `PartialResultException`, you can handle this situation effectively. Here's an example:

```java
public class LargeDatasetProcessor {
    private static final int CHUNK_SIZE = 1000;

    public void processDataset(List<DataRecord> dataset) {
        int totalRecords = dataset.size();
        int processedRecords = 0;

        while (processedRecords < totalRecords) {
            try {
                List<DataRecord> chunk = dataset.subList(processedRecords, Math.min(processedRecords + CHUNK_SIZE, totalRecords));
                analyzeChunk(chunk);
                processedRecords += CHUNK_SIZE;
            } catch (PartialResultException e) {
                List<DataRecord> partialResult = e.getPartialResult();
                reportPartialResult(partialResult);
                // Handle or log the exception, or take necessary corrective actions
            }
        }

        // Process remaining records, if any
        List<DataRecord> remainingRecords = dataset.subList(processedRecords, totalRecords);
        analyzeRemaining(remainingRecords);
    }

    private void analyzeChunk(List<DataRecord> chunk) throws PartialResultException {
        // Analyze the chunk and throw PartialResultException if needed
    }

    private void analyzeRemaining(List<DataRecord> remainingRecords) {
        // Analyze the remaining records
    }

    private void reportPartialResult(List<DataRecord> partialResult) {
        // Report or process the partial result as required
    }
}
```

In the above example, `processDataset` method processes the dataset in fixed-sized chunks, handling `PartialResultException` whenever it occurs. The `analyzeChunk` method performs the actual analysis of each chunk and throws `PartialResultException` if the result is partial. The `reportPartialResult` method is responsible for reporting or processing the partial result, ensuring that it does not go unnoticed.

### Example 2: Retrieving Data from Multiple Sources

Another scenario where `PartialResultException` can be beneficial is when retrieving data from multiple sources, such as APIs or databases. Occasionally, a failure in obtaining data from one source may not affect the retrieval from other sources. By capturing partial results within `PartialResultException`, developers can handle such situations efficiently. Consider the following example:

```java
public class MultiSourceDataRetriever {
    public Data retrieveData() {
        Data mergedResult = new Data();

        try {
            Data source1Result = retrieveFromSource1();
            mergedResult.merge(source1Result);
        } catch (PartialResultException e) {
            Data partialResult = e.getPartialResult();
            mergedResult.merge(partialResult);
            // Handle or log the exception, or take necessary corrective actions
        }

        try {
            Data source2Result = retrieveFromSource2();
            mergedResult.merge(source2Result);
        } catch (PartialResultException e) {
            Data partialResult = e.getPartialResult();
            mergedResult.merge(partialResult);
            // Handle or log the exception, or take necessary corrective actions
        }

        // Retrieve from other sources if necessary

        return mergedResult;
    }

    private Data retrieveFromSource1() throws PartialResultException {
        // Retrieve data from source 1 and throw PartialResultException if needed
    }

    private Data retrieveFromSource2() throws PartialResultException {
        // Retrieve data from source 2 and throw PartialResultException if needed
    }
}
```

In this example, `retrieveData` method retrieves data from two different sources, with `PartialResultException` being handled individually for each source. The retrieved results are merged using the `merge` method to form the final result. In case of partial results, the partial result is merged, and appropriate actions or logging can be performed.

## Implementing PartialResultException

Implementing `PartialResultException` in Java is straightforward. Here's an example implementation:

```java
public class PartialResultException extends RuntimeException {
    private final List<DataRecord> partialResult;

    public PartialResultException(List<DataRecord> partialResult) {
        this.partialResult = partialResult;
    }

    public List<DataRecord> getPartialResult() {
        return partialResult;
    }
}
```

The `PartialResultException` class extends the `RuntimeException` class and includes a private field `partialResult`, which represents the partial result to be encapsulated within the exception. The constructor accepts the partial result as a parameter and initializes the field accordingly. The getter method, `getPartialResult`, provides access to the encapsulated partial result.
