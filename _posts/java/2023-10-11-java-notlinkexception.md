Being a coder in the Java programming language involves not just writing fancy code but understanding exceptions that are thrown by compiler & interpreter and knowing how to debug them to keep your application running super smooth. One such exception a Java developer can encounter is the `NotLinkException` that might seem a tad complex and intimidating at first. In this article, we will unmask the `NotLinkException` in Java, an exception you might stumble upon while working with file systems in Java's version NIO.2.

## Understanding the NotLinkException

The `NotLinkException` belongs to the group of checked exceptions. It is precisely thrown when the file system operation fails, usually when the operation expects a symbolic link (a.k.a soft link), but the path does not point to one. The liberating news is that there's no reason to feel overwhelmed with this exception, as solutions are available.

```java
Path path = Paths.get("/path/to/a/non-linked-file");
Path target = Files.readSymbolicLink(path);
```

The above code will throw a `NotLinkException` as it tries to read a symbolic link from a path that points to a non-linked file.

## Handling the NotLinkException

The first and foremost method of handling any checked exception, including `NotLinkException` is using a try-catch block. This way, you can catch the exception and provide an appropriate reaction to it.

```java
Path path = Paths.get("/path/to/a/non-linked-file");
try {
    Path target = Files.readSymbolicLink(path);
} catch (NotLinkException e) {
    System.err.println(path + " is not a symbolic link.");
}
```

This straightforward and elegant approach prompts the program to prevent the propagation of the error by notifying the user about the issue and keeps your application from crashing.

Another approach to dodging this exception would be to place a preventive "if-then" condition to only begin the operation if the path indeed points to a symbolic link.

```java
Path path = Paths.get("/path/to/a/file");
if (Files.isSymbolicLink(path)) {
    Path target = Files.readSymbolicLink(path);
} else {
    System.err.println(path + " is not a symbolic link.");
}
```

While this is a failsafe method and prevents the exception from occurring in the first place, it can make your code voluminous if you need to perform numerous file operations.

## Creating Symbolic Links in Java

A practical way to avoid the `NotLinkException` is by creating symbolic links for your file operations when you require them. You can do this in Java using the `Files.createSymbolicLink()` method.

```java
Path newLink = Paths.get("/path/to/the/new-link");
Path existingFile = Paths.get("/path/to/the/existing-file");
try {
    Files.createSymbolicLink(newLink, existingFile);
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.err.println(e);
}
```

## Conclusion

The `NotLinkException` in Java is an essential exception that you, as a Java programmer, should know to handle with grace to continue building robust software. Although initially overwhelming, understanding and handling `NotLinkException` could be simplified and mastered with a little dedication and practice.

Remember, exceptions in Java are not roadblocks but tools to understand what your code requires from you. So the next time you encounter a `NotLinkException`, you know exactly what your program is requesting, and of course, how to fulfill it!
