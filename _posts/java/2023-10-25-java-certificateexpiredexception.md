Experiencing a `CertificateExpiredException` in your Java application? You’re not alone. This guide will provide a clear explanation of the `CertificateExpiredException` in Java, detail the impacts it could potentially have on your program, and help you understand how to handle and resolve this issue. 

## What is a CertificateExpiredException?

At its core, a CertificateExpiredException is an error that occurs when the certificate utilized by a Java-enabled application or website has expired. This CertificateExpiredException extends the parent `CertificateException` and is a part of the `java.security.cert` package.

The typical code snippet that raises this exception looks something like this:

```java
try {
    myCert.checkValidity();
}
catch (java.security.cert.CertificateExpiredException e)
 {
    System.out.println(e);
}
```

In the above code snippet, `myCert.checkValidity()` is a method call that checks whether the certificate is currently valid. If the certificate is expired, an instance of `CertificateExpiredException` is raised.

## Why is it important?

SSL certificates are crucial for the security of web applications. They provide the application with identification and ensure a secure connection between servers and clients, typically a web server (website) and a browser. 

Having an expired SSL certificate impacts the trust relationship between your application and its users because the protection of users’ sensitive information could be compromised. The `CertificateExpiredException` in Java therefore plays a key role in informing you that your SSL certificates need to be updated, thus maintaining the security and credibility of your application.

## How to handle the CertificateExpiredException

Handling these exceptions is a necessary part of application development. Let’s illustrate this with an example:

```java
try {
    myCert.checkValidity();
} catch (CertificateExpiredException e) {
    System.out.println("Certificate has expired and needs to be updated." + e);
} catch (CertificateNotYetValidException e) {
    System.out.println("Certificate is not yet valid." + e);
} 
```

In the example, we check the validity of the SSL certificate. If the certificate is expired, a `CertificateExpiredException` is raised, and the application alerts system admins to update the certificate. If the certificate is not yet valid, a `CertificateNotYetValidException` is raised instead.

## How to fix the CertificateExpiredException

Upon experiencing the CertificateExpiredException, you should renew your expired SSL certificate. This can be done with the entity that issued your certificate – a Certificate Authority (CA). 

To verify if the exception is fixed after the renewal, run the `checkValidity()` method again which should now carry out without raising any exception.

```java
try {
    myCert.checkValidity();
} catch (CertificateExpiredException e) {
    System.out.println("The certificate is still expired! Please verify." + e);
}
```

Having an effective error handling regimen in place and monitoring for exceptions such as `CertificateExpiredException` ensures the success and security of your application.

In conclusion, dealing with the CertificateExpiredException is essential in maintaining the security of your application. It is crucial to have systems in place to deal with such scenarios and continually ensure your SSL certificates remain up-to-date. Once understood, tackling the `CertificateExpiredException` is straightforward and contributes significantly to the overall robustness of your application.
