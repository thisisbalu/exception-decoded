Meet the troublemaker in the form of Java exceptions, and conquer XPath queries with confidence.

The Java world is vast and filled with many exceptional situations, some easy to handle and some bewildering at first. Today, we are zeroing in on a pesky one -- the `XPathExpressionException`. Let's go beyond the usual and deep dive into its depths to understand, handle, and avoid such an exception. We are going to shed light on this exception via real-world code examples - as they say, code never lies!

## Meet The XPathExpressionException

The `XPathExpressionException` is fundamentally thrown when an XPath expression cannot be understood, evaluated, or executed. It often shows its face when there is any flaw or irregularity in XPath syntax or evaluation.

```java
import javax.xml.xpath.XPathExpressionException;
```

Looking inside the Java hierarchy, `XPathExpressionException` extends `XPathException`, which in turn extends `Exception`, the root of all checked exceptions in Java.

## When Does the XPathExpressionException Occur?

Let's take an example to understand when the `XPathExpressionException` can manifest.

```java
import javax.xml.xpath.*;
import org.xml.sax.InputSource;
import java.io.StringReader;

public class ExampleXPathExpressionException {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws XPathExpressionException {
        XPath xpath = XPathFactory.newInstance().newXPath();
        String expression = "//book[title";  // Incorrect syntax
        xpath.compile(expression);    // Will throw XPathExpressionException
    }
}
```

In the example above, our XPath expression is missing the closing square bracket. As a result, when Java tries to compile the XPath expression, an `XPathExpressionException` is thrown.

## Handling the XPathExpressionException

Java provides us with robust error handling mechanisms. To address `XPathExpressionException`, we would wrap the code that might throw the exception inside a try-catch block.

```java
public class HandleXPathExpressionException {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        XPath xpath = XPathFactory.newInstance().newXPath();
        String expression = "//book[title";  
        
        try {
            xpath.compile(expression);   
        } catch (XPathExpressionException e) {
            System.out.println("XPathExpressionException occurred");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In the code above, we safely handle the `XPathExpressionException`. When the problematic line of Java code runs, instead of crashing the whole application, the code inside the catch block executes.

## Sidestepping the XPathExpressionException

Prevention is better than cure. There are ways to avoid this exception entirely. The major precaution you can take is to make sure your XPath statement is correctly formed.

In most cases, when you work with XML files, XPath queries are not dynamically generated; they are predefined. As such, you can minimize the chances of `XPathExpressionException` by thoroughly testing your XPath expressions beforehand using third-party XPath testing tools like XPath tester, XPath evaluator, etc.

As a fallback, encapsulating the relevant code into try-catch blocks to provide a safety net when exceptions are thrown is always a good practice.

## Conclusion

To sum, `XPathExpressionException` tends to occur when there's an issue with XPath syntax or evaluation. However, understanding its root cause, implementing proactive checks, and handling exceptions can ensure a smoother XML parsing journey for any Java developer.

Understanding such exceptions is the key to building robust and resilient applications that can withstand and adapt to any edge cases and irregularities that might occur.
