Overcoming database hurdles has never been this easy! Are you a Java developer working with SQL databases? Are you often baffled by the `SQLSyntaxErrorException` while performing database operations? If so, get ready to take an enlightening deep dive into the world of Java exceptions and learn how to confidently deal with this common pitfall. This article is an all-encompassing guide explaining what `SQLSyntaxErrorException` is, why it occurs, and how to handle it effectively.

## What is SQLSyntaxErrorException?

`SQLSyntaxErrorException` is a subclass of `java.sql.SQLException` used to indicate a SQL syntax error. It provides information on a database access error or other errors related to JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). 

```java
public class SQLSyntaxErrorException
extends SQLNonTransientException
```

## The Root Cause of SQLSyntaxErrorException

Every seasoned developer knows that knowing your enemy is half the battle won. So, let's understand the common causes of this kind of exception:

1. Incorrect SQL Syntax: SQL syntax is violated. An example can be a misleading comma, a missing `WHERE` clause, or maybe an `INSERT` query without `VALUES`.
2. Invalid TableName/ColumnName: Using non-existing table names or column names in queries.
3. Incorrect Parameter Types: By providing a parameter of an incorrect data type, e.g., supplying a string to an integer parameter.

Let's take a small example illustrating `SQLSyntaxErrorException`.

```java
try {
    Statement stmt = con.createStatement();
    String updateSalarySql = "UPDATE Employee SET slary = 1000 WHERE id = 101";
    // Notice the wrongly spelled column name "slary"
    stmt.executeUpdate(updateSalarySql);
} catch (SQLSyntaxErrorException e) {
   e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In this example, the SQL update statement tries to update a non-existing column `slary` in the `Employee` table. Hence, a `SQLSyntaxErrorException` is logged.

## How to Handle SQLSyntaxErrorException?

Identifying and escaping `SQLSyntaxErrorException` is a reliable way to sustain smooth database communications. Thankfully, Java offers several ways to handle such exceptions:

### Exception Handling Using Try-Catch 

The easiest way to catch an exception is by using a try-catch block. Catch the exception and handle it in a way that makes the most sense for your application.

```java
try {
    // some code that might throw SQLSyntaxErrorException
} catch (SQLSyntaxErrorException ex) {
    // handle the exception
    System.out.println("A SQLSyntaxErrorException was thrown: " + ex.getMessage());
}
```

### Validation of SQL Query 

It's a good practice to validate SQL queries before executing them on the server. Numerous libraries, such as jOOQ (Java Object Oriented Querying), enable SQL validation in Java.

```
DSLContext create = DSL.using(con, SQLDialect.MYSQL);
// Define the SQL query
String sqlQuery = "SELECT wrongColumnName FROM Student";
// Validate the SQL query
try {
    create.parser().parseQuery(sqlQuery);
} catch (DataAccessException dae) {
    if (dae.getCause() instanceof SQLSyntaxErrorException) {
        System.out.println("SQL query syntax is incorrect!");
    }
}
```

Wherever possible, utilize PreparedStatements as opposed to Statements in JDBC. Not only does it boost performance, but it also provides a robust way of escaping SQL injection attacks. 

```java
String sqlQuery = "UPDATE Employee SET salary = ? WHERE id = ?";
PreparedStatement preparedStatement = conn.prepareStatement(sqlQuery);
preparedStatement.setInt(1, 1000);
preparedStatement.setInt(2 , 101);
preparedStatement.executeUpdate();
```

## Conclusion

As a Java developer working with SQL databases, `SQLSyntaxErrorException` can often be a stumbling block. However, understanding the root causes and foreseeing occurrence probability can help you stay several steps ahead. Being cautious with your SQL syntax, validating your queries prior to execution, and harnessing the power of PreparedStatements are your best bets against such exceptions. This hands-on post aims to clear your road of any `SQLSyntaxErrorException` hurdles, helping you cruise smoothly towards your coding goals.
