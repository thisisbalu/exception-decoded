Java never ceases to challenge us with its carefully designed hierarchy of exceptions and errors. Among them, an often overlooked but crucial one is the `WritePendingException`. This underdog of exceptions can embody the divide-and-conquer philosophy of handling program errors, if understood correctly. This article will shine light on the `WritePendingException` in-depth, exploring its origin, instances of triggering, and ideal ways to handle it. We'll also include plenty of illustrative code snippets for a better understanding. Let's dive in!

## What is WritePendingException?

Java's `java.nio.channels.WritePendingException` is a runtime exception exclusively thrown when an attempt is initiated to invoke a write operation, whilst an ongoing write operation is under process on a certain channel. 

```java
import java.nio.*;
import java.nio.channels.*;

try {
    AsynchronousSocketChannel channel = AsynchronousSocketChannel.open();
    ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
    channel.write(buffer);
    // The second write operation throws WritePendingException
    channel.write(buffer);
} catch (WritePendingException wpe) {
    wpe.printStackTrace();
}
```

In the above example, two `write` operations consecutively executed within the same `AsynchronousSocketChannel` led to a `WritePendingException`.

## Significance of WritePendingException

Notably, `WritePendingException` ensures the non-concurrency of write operations within the same channel, helping Java maintain data integrity and synchronization.

When working with non-blocking I/O operations, be sure to enforce synchronized access control if multiple threads are attempting to perform write operations. A lack of synchronization paves the path towards overlapping `write` operations, triggering the `WritePendingException`.

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.*;
import java.nio.channels.*;

public class TestWritePendingException {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        AsynchronousSocketChannel channel = AsynchronousSocketChannel.open();
        ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
        
        new Thread(() -> {
            channel.write(buffer);
        }).start();

        new Thread(() -> {
            channel.write(buffer);
        }).start();
    }
}
```

In the above code, two threads are attempting to write to the same buffer simultaneously, thereby creating a situation to throw `WritePendingException`.

## Exception Handling and Best Practices

While handling `WritePendingException`, there's emphasis on either preventive or damage control approaches. A preventive approach revolves around synchronized access in multi-threaded environments, while the latter roots itself in managing exceptions gracefully post-occurance.

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.*;
import java.nio.channels.*;

class WritePendingTest {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      AsynchronousSocketChannel channel = AsynchronousSocketChannel.open();
      ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
      Object lock = new Object();
      new Thread(() -> {
        synchronized (lock) {
          channel.write(buffer);
        }
      }).start();
      new Thread(() -> {
        synchronized (lock) {
          channel.write(buffer);
        }
      }).start();
    } catch (IOException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}

```
Above, exceptions can be avoided by providing synchronized access to these threads, thereby enabling sequential and non-overlapping writes.

A good practice is to minimally handle exceptions where necessary, thus paving the way for cleaner and more maintainable code.

```java
try {
  AsynchronousSocketChannel channel = AsynchronousSocketChannel.open();
  ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
  channel.write(buffer);
  channel.write(buffer);
} catch (WritePendingException wpe) {
  wpe.printStackTrace();
}
```

Make sure to catch any `WritePendingException` and ultimately deal with the error in an appropriate manner like logging, re-trying, or failing safely to provide a robust solution.

## Conclusion

Always remember, each exception in Java tells a story about what went wrong, which we should understand and handle judiciously. `WritePendingException` is a reminder that adequate synchronisation is pertinent in non-blocking I/O operations. It calls for attention to constructing sequential write operations to uphold data integrity. Not overlooking this exception is the first step towards mastering exception handling!
