In this blog post, we will be delving into the **UnsupportedOperationException** in Java; unraveling its purpose, when and how we should use it. By the end of this, you will grasp insights into this particular exception, mastering how to effectively use it in your Java programs.

## Let's Begin With What Is UnsupportedOperationException?

[UnsupportedOperationException](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/UnsupportedOperationException.html) is a runtime exception that belongs to the java.lang package. As per Java documentation, this exception is thrown to indicate that the requested operation is not supported. This is an unchecked exception, meaning it is not necessary to provide a try/catch block or throw declaration for it.

## When Should UnsupportedOperationException in Java be Used?

UnsupportedOperationException should be used in scenarios where specific operations are not supported by an object. They are predominantly used in the collections framework where an unmodifiable collection does not support the add or remove operation.

Here is an example:
```java
List<String> unmodifiableList = Collections.unmodifiableList(Arrays.asList("John", "Mary", "Peter"));
unmodifiableList.add("Alice"); // This line throws UnsupportedOperationException
```
In this code snippet, as the list is immutable (unmodifiable), attempting to append an element to the list results in an UnsupportedOperationException.

## How to Handle UnsupportedOperationException?

The best way to handle an UnsupportedOperationException is to understand whether or not a particular operation is supported before performing it. As illustrated in the example before, adding an element to an unmodifiable list is inappropriate and therefore, should be avoided. 

Alternatively, we can employ a try/catch block to handle this exception:
```java
try {
    unmodifiableList.add("Alice");
} catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
     System.out.println("Can't add an element to a unmodifiable list");
}
```
In the scenario above, if UnsupportedOperationException is thrown, our program will not terminate abruptly; instead, it will catch the exception and print the error message.

## UnsupportedOperationException versus OperationNotSupportedException

Thereâ€™s another exception that sounds eerily similar to UnsupportedOperationException, and often causes confusion: [OperationNotSupportedException](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.desktop/javax/naming/OperationNotSupportedException.html). OperationNotSupportedException is intended for directory like naming services, and it's a checked exception. It indicates that a particular operation cannot be performed by the naming/directory service whereas UnsupportedOperationException is more generic and usually used when methods are not supported in certain collections or in user implemented methods.

In closing, understanding how and when to handle the UnsupportedOperationException can minimize unnecessary crashes and improve the quality of your Java application. Knowledge about UnsupportedOperationException equips developers to write error resilient code, fostering optimal execution of Java programs. Remember, it's always important to have proper exception handling in your Java code, to avoid unexpected crashes!
