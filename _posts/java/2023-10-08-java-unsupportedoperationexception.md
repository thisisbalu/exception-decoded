Java is an object-oriented language widely praised for its 'Write Once, Run Anywhere' (WORA) capability. But like any language, it has its fair share of exceptions and errors that can be overwhelming especially to novice programmers. Today we delve into one such exception - the UnsupportedOperationException. 

## 1. Introduction to UnsupportedOperationException

The `UnsupportedOperationException` class is a member of the `java.lang` package. It inherits from the `RuntimeException` class which is a subclass of the `Exception` class. This type of exception often crops up when we are trying to modify an immutable object, i.e., an object that is unchangeable once it is created. 

```java
List<String> immutableList = Arrays.asList("Java", "Python", "C++");
immutableList.add("Ruby"); // throws java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException
```

In the code sample above, we are trying to add a new item to a list that is immutable, thus triggering the `UnsupportedOperationException`.

## 2. When Does UnsupportedOperationException Occur?

The `UnsupportedOperationException` occurs when we invoke methods that are not supported by an object. Such a situation can arise in contexts where the Java Collections Framework is in use. For instance, the `remove()`, `add()` or `clear()` methods may not be supported for some collections like `Arrays.asList()` or `Collections.unmodifiableList()`.

Another setup where this exception might emerge is when using the Iterator interface, specifically its `remove()` method.

## 3. How to Handle UnsupportedOperationException?

An ideal way to deal with this exception is by performing thorough null-checks and pre-validations before invoking such methods. Also, consider using a mutable object instead if you intend to modify it.

```java
List<String> mutableList = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("Java", "Python", "C++"));
mutableList.add("Ruby"); // No exception thrown as the list is mutable
```

This time we’re initializing an ArrayList with values from an array, resulting in a mutable list where adding new items doesn’t trigger an exception.

## 4. Can UnsupportedOperationException be Caught?

Yes, it can be caught by using try-catch blocks like any other exception:

```java
try {
    List<String> immutableList = Arrays.asList("Java", "Python", "C++");
    immutableList.add("Ruby");
} catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
    System.out.println("Method not supported");
}
```

In the code snippet above, the catch block is executed when `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown and the message "Method not supported" is printed to the console. 

However, catching this exception is frowned upon, hoping for a program to continue as if nothing catastrophic happened. It is akin to using error handling as a substitute for control flow.

## 5. Conclusion

The `UnsupportedOperationException` in Java is a runtime exception that is usually thrown when an invoked method is not supported by an object. By understanding when it occurs and how to handle it correctly, we can avoid it effectively in our day-to-day programming tasks.

Java's official documentation offers valuable insights and details about `UnsupportedOperationException` and one should definitely refer [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/UnsupportedOperationException.html) to gain a deeper understanding of this exception.

Remember, exception handling is an art in Java coding. Be mindful and ask the right questions before coding - is the operation you're attempting valid for the object? Making these preventative measures a habit ensures the robustness of our programs in the long run. Happy coding!
