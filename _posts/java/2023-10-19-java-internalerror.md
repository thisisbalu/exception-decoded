Greetings to all java enthusiasts, programmers, and developers out there! One of the most unique instances that you often bump into while writing Java codes is the impressive `InternalError`. It's an integral part of the Java programming language and understanding how to handle it can improve your programming efficiency. This article details the exhaustive concept about `InternalError` in Java, with relevant examples and tactics to handle it. 

## What is InternalError in Java?

The `InternalError` in Java, an instance of [Throwable](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Throwable.html) class and subclass of [VirtualMachineError](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/VirtualMachineError.html), is an error that your Java Virtual Machine (JVM) throws when an internal error occurs. These errors are unexpected inconsistencies produced by the JVM that it cannot recover from and are typically due to resource limitations or bugs in the JVM itself.

```java
public class InternalError extends VirtualMachineError
```

## Cases Where InternalError Can Occur

`InternalError` is typically thrown when JVM has exhausted all available resources it can use and cannot continue operation. Some significant examples could be StackOverflowError or OutOfMemoryError. It could also happen in exceptional cases when there's a bug with the JVM itself. 

## Example of InternalError in Java

Take a look at the following program to understand how the `InternalError` might show up;

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            causeInternalError();
        } catch (InternalError e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            System.out.println("Caught InternalError");
        }
    }

    static void causeInternalError() {
        causeInternalError();
    }
}
```

In this recursive method `causeInternalError()`, you wind up with an infinite loop as the method keeps calling itself. Eventually, the Java stack overflows resulting in a StackOverflowError which is a type of InternalError.

## How to Handle the InternalError?

Though it's worthy to note that `InternalError` is not something you try to handle routinely as it is an `Error` and not an `Exception`. And it is strongly recommended that one should not make a habit of catching `Error` or subtypes.

```java
try {
    // code that can potentially throw InternalError
} catch (InternalError e) {
    // handling code
}
```

As a developer, your best course of action is to fix the condition causing the error rather than trying to catch it. This usually involves rectifying resource limitations or reporting the problem to your JVM vendor.

## Recap

To sum up, the `InternalError` is a type of error that arises when the JVM encounters an internal error it cannot recover from. It's more often out of the programmer's control. The preferred way to deal with it is to prevent the root causes rather than write code to handle it explicitly.

We hope this article has been enlightening and gives you a solid grasp of the concepts and intricacies of `InternalError` in Java. For more Java experiences and learnings, continue to follow our blog posts.
