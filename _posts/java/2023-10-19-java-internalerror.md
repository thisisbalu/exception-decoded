Java is among the most sought programming languages in the world. It's a robust, object-oriented language used to develop applications ranging from mobile apps to large-scale enterprise systems. Despite its powerful features, Java developers often encounter errors such as `InternalError` which can be a bit of a head-scratcher. This article takes a deep dive into understanding, troubleshooting, and resolving the Java `InternalError`.

## What is the InternalError in Java?

In Java, `InternalError` is a subclass of `VirtualMachineError`, which itself extends the `Error` class. According to the [Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/InternalError.html), the `InternalError` is thrown to indicate a severe problem that has occurred in the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**, but it does not apply to errors like class not found, out of memory, etc. Typically, it hints towards rare circumstances like resource exhaustion or bugs in JVM.

Below is the class hierarchy of `InternalError` in Java:
```java
java.lang.Object
  ↳ java.lang.Throwable
    ↳ java.lang.Error
      ↳ java.lang.VirtualMachineError
        ↳ java.lang.InternalError
```
The constructor summary for `InternalError` in Java is as follows:
```java
InternalError() // Constructs an InternalError with no detail message.
InternalError(String message) // Constructs an InternalError with the specified detail message.
InternalError(String message, Throwable cause) // Constructs an InternalError with the specified detail message and cause.
InternalError(Throwable cause) // Constructs a new instance of InternalError with the specified cause.
```
## When Does InternalError Occur?

The `InternalError` in Java occurs under rare, unexpected circumstances like an internal JVM malfunction. For instance, an `InternalError` may be thrown during the JVM's startup phase if it has insufficient resources to operate, or due to JVM bugs.

Let's consider an example:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main.doSomethingDangerous();
    }
  
    private static void doSomethingDangerous() {
        throw new InternalError();
    }
}
```
In the above code, the program explicitly throws an `InternalError`, which should only be used to denote severe problems that occur inside the JVM. 

## How to Handle InternalError in Java?

While it is possible to handle `InternalError` using a `try-catch` block, it is not recommended because `InternalError` is often indicative of a serious problem -- essentially, a sign of a bug in JVM or your system's configuration. These errors are not expected to be recoverable, so handling them could lead to unpredictable outcomes. 

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Main.doSomethingDangerous();
        } catch(InternalError error) {
            error.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    private static void doSomethingDangerous() {
        throw new InternalError();
    }
}
```

## How to Resolve InternalError in Java?

Here are some steps to follow if you encounter the `InternalError`:

1. **Check your code**:  Ensure that you're not manually throwing an `InternalError`. If that's the case, consider if it's necessary or if another Exception or Error subclass would be more appropriate.

2. **Update your JVM**: If your JVM is outdated, there might be a bug triggering the error. Updating to the latest version could solve the problem. 

3. **Check your System's Resources**: If your system is low on resources, it might impact the JVM's operation leading to an `InternalError`. 

4. **Reach Out for Help**: If you've checked your code, updated your JVM, and ensured that your system resources are not the issue, it might be a bug in the JVM. In that case, it's time to reach out to the JVM vendor or discuss it in Java community forums. 

That was our deep dive into the `InternalError` in Java. Remember, such errors are serious and often indicate a problem with JVM or your system configuration. With the best coding practices and a keeps eye on your system resources, you should be able to avoid these issues, keeping your Java applications running smoothly.
