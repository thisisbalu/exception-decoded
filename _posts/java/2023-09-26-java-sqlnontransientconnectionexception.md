## An In-Depth Understanding of SQLNonTransientConnectionException in Java

If you are a Java developer, you are likely to confront several exceptions in your career, and SQLNonTransientConnectionException is no exception. This blog post is all set to describe it in detail - what it is, when it occurs, and how to resolve it.

Firstly, isn't it just apt to shed light on what SQLNonTransientConnectionException is? 

SQLNonTransientConnectionException is hailed as a subclass of `java.sql.SQLException.` It is thrown when a connection exception has taken a position that does not fall under the transient category. A perfect instance of non-transient failure is an invalid password supplied by the user.

```java
try(Connection conn=DriverManager.getConnection(DB_URL, USER, PASSWORD))
{
// logic here
}
catch(SQLException e)
{
if(e instanceof SQLNonTransientConnectionException){
System.out.println("Non transient connection exception: "+e.getMessage());
}
else{
e.printStackTrace();
}
}
```

One can call `SQLNonTransientConnectionException`, a universal `SQLException` that offers vast, superior error tracking and dealing with SQL exceptions. Let's dive deeper!

## When Does SQLNonTransientConnectionException Occur?

This exception sprouts when the SQLState class value commences with values '08', apart from '08S01'. Surprised what these codes imply? '08' signifies Connection Exception, and '08S01' corresponds to a transient connection exception like the case when your database server gets suddenly shut down. When the status code is anything except '08S01', it's a NonTransient Connection Exception.

```java
try (Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(db_url, username, password)) {
    // Code goes here
} catch (SQLException ex) {
    if (ex instanceof SQLTransientConnectionException)
        System.err.println("Transient exception: " + ex.getMessage());
    else if (ex instanceof SQLNonTransientConnectionException)
        System.err.println("Non-Transient exception: " + ex.getMessage());
    else ex.printStackTrace();
}
```
## How to Solve SQLNonTransientConnectionException?

The way to tackle this exception is by finding out the cause of the connection failure.  Was it due to an incorrect JDBC url? Or maybe invalid user credentials?

Here is a streamlined way to track the cause:

```java
try (Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(db_url, username, password)) {
    // Executing queries
} catch (SQLException ex) {
    if (ex instanceof SQLNonTransientConnectionException) {
        Throwable cause = ex.getCause();
        while (cause != null) {
            System.err.println("Caused by: " + cause);
            cause = cause.getCause();
        }
    }

    ex.printStackTrace();  // Prints the stack trace for further reference
}
```
The primary takeaway from the understudy is that Connection Exceptions are common in any programming, especially when dealing with databases. We hope you have a thorough understanding of the `SQLNonTransientConnectionException` in Java and how it is segregated from other SQL Exceptions.

* [Database - JDBC](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/sql/package-summary.html)

Remember, practical knowledge is the key. So get your hands dirty and conquer the world of Java Programming!

This article covers how to deal with one of the many exceptions you might encounter when working with Java Database Connectivity (JDBC). If you found it useful, feel free to share it with your network. Happy coding, folks.
