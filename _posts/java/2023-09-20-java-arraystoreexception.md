Java, an object-oriented, class-based language, stands as one of the most widely-used programming languages worldwide, due to its flexibility, functionality, and compatibility. However, even with a robust language like Java, developers may encounter a variety of exceptions while coding - one such exception that we will be discussing in today's blog post is `ArrayStoreException`. 

## Deploying the ArrayStoreException

`ArrayStoreException` is a [RuntimeException](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/RuntimeException.html) in Java which typically shows up when you attempt to store an incompatible element into an array. 

``` java
Object x[] = new String[3];
x[0] = new Integer(0); //This line will throw ArrayStoreException at runtime.
```

In the above example, we are attempting to store an `Integer` object into an array of `String` objects, which is not permissible â€“ hence the `ArrayStoreException` arises. 

## Understanding the Root Cause

Let's delve deeper into the root cause of `ArrayStoreException`. It occurs chiefly when you violate the fundamental rule of adding elements to an array, that is, when you try adding an element of one datatype into an array of a differing datatype. In simple terms, if the runtime type of the array doesn't match with the object type you're trying to insert, Java throws an `ArrayStoreException`.

## Encounter ArrayStoreException in a Real World Scenario

Consider the following scenario. 

``` java
class Animal {}
class Dog extends Animal {}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal[] animals = new Dog[10];
        animals[0] = new Animal(); //This will raise an ArrayStoreException at runtime.
        animals[0] = new Dog(); //This will work fine.
   }
}
```

Here, an `ArrayStoreException` happens because a `Dog` IS an `Animal` (due to inheritance), but an `Animal` IS NOT a `Dog`. The array was initialized to hold `Dog` objects, so attempting to add an `Animal` object will throw an exception.

## How to Avoid the ArrayStoreException?

You may follow the simple rule - Only add objects into the array that are instances of the class used to create the array.

``` java
Object x[] = new String[3];
x[0] = new String("ArrayStoreException"); //This will run successfully.
```

## Exception Handling

Exception handling is an important part of application development. In the case of `ArrayStoreException`, we can handle it using try-catch blocks:

``` java
try {
    Object x[] = new String[3];
    x[0] = new Integer(0); //This line will throw ArrayStoreException at runtime.
} catch (ArrayStoreException ex) {
    ex.printStackTrace(); 
}
```

This way, instead of abruptly terminating, the application prints the exception stack trace, thereby allowing developers to investigate and correct the root problem. 

## Bidding Adieu

By now, you have a firm understanding of what an `ArrayStoreException` is, its causative factors, and how to handle this exception astutely. Remember, mastering Java exceptions plays an integral part in your journey as a proficient Java developer. So, make sure you have a thorough knowledge on exceptions to write efficient, error-less code.
