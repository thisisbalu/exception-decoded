## Introduction
WebSocket is a communication protocol that allows for real-time communication between a client and a server over a single, long-lived connection. It provides a bidirectional data channel that is more efficient than traditional HTTP request-response cycles for applications that require continuous data exchange.

In Java, the WebSocket API is supported since the introduction of Java EE 7. However, during the development and implementation of WebSocket-based applications, you may encounter exceptions like `WebSocketHandshakeException`. This article will explore the WebSocketHandshakeException in Java, its causes, and how to handle and troubleshoot it effectively.

## What is `WebSocketHandshakeException`?
`WebSocketHandshakeException` is a runtime exception that occurs during the handshake phase of the WebSocket protocol. The handshake phase is the initial exchange of information between the client and the server to establish a WebSocket connection. This exception indicates a failure in establishing the connection.

## Common Causes of `WebSocketHandshakeException`
1. Mismatched or Invalid WebSocket URL:
   The WebSocket URL used by the client may be incorrect or malformed. It should include the proper protocol (`ws://` or `wss://`) and a valid host address.

2. Firewall or Network Restrictions:
   A misconfigured firewall or network restrictions can prevent the WebSocket handshake from completing successfully. Ensure that the necessary ports (80 for `ws://` or 443 for `wss://`) are open and accessible.

3. Server-Side Configuration Issues:
   Incorrect server-side configuration can lead to a WebSocket handshake failure. Verify that the server is correctly set up to handle WebSocket connections and that the WebSocket endpoint is properly registered.

4. Invalid WebSocket Upgrade Request:
   The client may be sending an invalid WebSocket upgrade request. Check the request headers and ensure they comply with the WebSocket specification.

5. SSL Certificate Issues:
   When using a secure WebSocket connection (`wss://`), SSL certificate errors can occur if the certificate is expired, self-signed, or not trusted. Verify the validity and trustworthiness of the SSL certificate.

## Handling `WebSocketHandshakeException`
To handle `WebSocketHandshakeException` gracefully, you need to properly catch and handle the exception in your code. Here is an example of how you can handle this exception using Java's exception handling mechanism:

```java
try {
    // Code to establish WebSocket connection
} catch (WebSocketHandshakeException ex) {
    // Handle the exception by logging or displaying an error message
    ex.printStackTrace();
}
```

Upon catching the exception, you can choose to log the error, display a user-friendly message, or take any appropriate action based on your application's requirements.

## Troubleshooting `WebSocketHandshakeException`
When troubleshooting `WebSocketHandshakeException`, it's essential to identify the root cause. Here are some steps you can follow to troubleshoot this exception effectively:

1. Verify the WebSocket URL:
   Double-check the WebSocket URL being used by the client. Ensure that it follows the correct format and includes the necessary protocol and host information.

2. Check Firewall and Network Settings:
   Ensure that any firewalls or network restrictions in place allow WebSocket traffic on the appropriate ports. You may need to consult your network administrator or adjust firewall settings accordingly.

3. Review Server-Side Configuration:
   Check the server-side configuration for any errors or misconfigurations. Ensure that the WebSocket endpoint is correctly registered and that the server can handle WebSocket connections.

4. Inspect Request and Response Headers:
   Examine the request and response headers exchanged during the handshake phase. Look for any discrepancies or invalid headers that could be causing the exception. Compare them to the WebSocket protocol specifications.

5. Verify SSL Certificate:
   If using a secure WebSocket connection (`wss://`), verify the SSL certificate's validity and trust. Ensure that the certificate is not expired, self-signed, or issued by an untrusted authority.

## Conclusion
WebSocketHandshakeException can occur during the handshake phase of the WebSocket protocol in Java. It indicates a failure in establishing the WebSocket connection due to various reasons such as URL mismatches, network restrictions, server-side configuration issues, invalid upgrade requests, or SSL certificate problems.

When encountering `WebSocketHandshakeException`, it is essential to handle and troubleshoot the exception effectively. By thoroughly reviewing the potential causes and following the troubleshooting steps provided, you can resolve the issue and establish a successful WebSocket connection.

For more information about WebSocket in Java, you can refer to the following resources:

Remember to always ensure the compatibility of your code with the specific WebSocket implementation and Java version you are using.

Happy WebSocket coding!
