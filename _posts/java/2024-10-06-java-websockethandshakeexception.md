Are you facing connection problems while using WebSocket in your Java application? Have you encountered a WebSocketHandshakeException? You've come to the right place! In this article, we will dive deep into what causes this exception and how to resolve it.

## Introduction

WebSocket is a communication protocol that enables two-way communication between a client and a server over a single, long-lived connection. It provides a persistent connection, allowing real-time data exchange without the overhead of HTTP polling. Java provides robust support for WebSocket with its Java WebSocket API, simplifying the development of real-time web applications.

However, sometimes WebSocketHandshakeException occurs, indicating an issue during the handshake process. The handshake is an initial exchange of data between the client and the server, establishing the WebSocket connection. Let's explore the common causes and resolutions for this exception.

## Common Causes of WebSocketHandshakeException

1. **Protocol Mismatch**: The client and server might be using different WebSocket protocols or versions. Ensure that both are using the same protocol, such as WebSocket RFC 6455.

2. **Invalid URL/Endpoint**: Double-check the URL or the endpoint address used by the client. Ensure it is correct, including the protocol prefix (e.g., `ws://` or `wss://` for secure WebSocket connections).

3. **Firewall or Proxy Restrictions**: Firewalls or proxies can sometimes interfere with WebSocket connections. Check if your network setup allows WebSocket connections and whether any specific configurations are required.

4. **SSL/TLS Certificate Issues**: If you're using secure WebSocket connections (wss://), verify if the SSL/TLS certificate is valid and trusted by the client. Self-signed or expired certificates can cause handshake failures.

5. **Server-Side Misconfiguration**: Ensure that the server-side WebSocket configurations are correct, such as the allowed origins, subprotocols, or extensions. Review the server code to rule out any misconfigurations or errors.

6. **Network Connection Interruption**: Temporary network issues, such as a dropped connection or a server timeout, can lead to handshake failures. Consider checking your network stability and retry the connection.

## Resolving WebSocketHandshakeException

Let's explore some techniques to troubleshoot and resolve the WebSocket handshake exception based on the common causes mentioned above.

### 1. Protocol Mismatch

Ensure that both the client and the server use the same WebSocket protocol and version. You can check the negotiated protocol version during the handshake by accessing the `Sec-WebSocket-Version` header on the client and server sides.

On the client side:
```java
ClientEndpointConfig clientEndpointConfig = ClientEndpointConfig.Builder.create().build();
ClientEndpointConfig.Configurator configurator = clientEndpointConfig.getConfigurator();
String negotiatedVersion = configurator.getNegotiatedSubprotocol(Collections.emptyList(), Collections.singletonList("Sec-WebSocket-Version:"));
```

On the server side:
```java
@OnOpen
public void onOpen(Session session, EndpointConfig endpointConfig) {
    String negotiatedVersion = (String) endpointConfig.getUserProperties().get("Sec-WebSocket-Version");
}
```

If the negotiated versions differ, ensure that both the client and server code are using the same version. Updating the code to use a compatible version can help resolve this issue.

### 2. Verify the URL/Endpoint

Double-check the URL or endpoint used by the client. Ensure that it is correct, includes the protocol prefix, and points to the WebSocket server. For example, make sure "ws://" or "wss://" is present at the beginning of the URL.

### 3. Firewall or Proxy Restrictions

Firewalls or proxies can sometimes interfere with WebSocket connections. Verify that your network environment allows WebSocket connections. Ensure that no specific configurations or proxy settings are hindering the WebSocket handshake.

If you encounter issues with a corporate network, consult with your network administrator to understand any restrictions and work on any necessary adjustments.

### 4. SSL/TLS Certificate Issues

When using secure WebSocket connections (`wss://`), ensure that the SSL/TLS certificate is valid and trusted by the client. Self-signed or expired certificates can cause handshake failures.

If you're testing in a development environment, you can disable certificate validation during testing. However, this should be used with caution and not for production environments. Here's an example of disabling certificate validation in Java:

```java
SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
sslContext.init(null, new TrustManager[]{new X509TrustManager() {
    public void checkClientTrusted(X509Certificate[] x509Certificates, String s) {}
    public void checkServerTrusted(X509Certificate[] x509Certificates, String s) {}
    public X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers() { return new X509Certificate[0]; }
}}, new SecureRandom());

ClientEndpointConfig clientEndpointConfig = ClientEndpointConfig.Builder.create().build();
clientEndpointConfig.getUserProperties().put("org.apache.tomcat.websocket.SSL_CONTEXT", sslContext);
```

Remember to restore proper certificate validation before deploying into production environments.

### 5. Server-Side Misconfiguration

Review the server-side code and configurations. Ensure that you've correctly configured the allowed origins, subprotocols, and extensions. For example, if you're using the Java WebSocket API with the Tyrus implementation, you can configure it as follows:

```java
@ServerEndpoint(
    value = "/my-ws-endpoint",
    configurator = MyEndpointConfigurator.class,
    encoders = { MyEncoder.class },
    decoders = { MyDecoder.class }
)
```

Ensure your server-side configuration matches the client-side requirements and the negotiated subprotocols.

### 6. Network Connection Interruption

Temporary network interruptions, such as dropped connections or server timeouts, can lead to WebSocket handshake failures. Verify your network stability and consider retrying the connection. Implementing appropriate error handling and retry mechanisms can help mitigate these issues.

## Conclusion

By understanding the common causes of the WebSocketHandshakeException and following the troubleshooting techniques mentioned in this article, you can overcome connection issues and ensure smooth WebSocket communication in your Java application.

Always remember to verify the protocol version, verify the URL/endpoint, consider network restrictions, handle SSL/TLS certificates correctly, and review your server-side configurations. With these steps, you will be well on your way to resolving WebSocketHandshakeException errors and building robust real-time applications.
