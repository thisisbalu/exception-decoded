Java's robust functionality offers numerous utilities out of the box. One such utility is RMI (Remote Method Invocation) which enables an object residing in one Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to make method calls on an object in a separate JVM. While using this powerful tool, you might occasionally encounter an `ExportException`. In this article, we are going to demystify the underlying concept of `ExportException`, explore cause scenarios and delve deep into troubleshooting methods with substantial code examples.

## Understanding the ExportException

`ExportException` is a subclass of `java.rmi.RemoteException` that occurs in the context of RMI. It is thrown if an attempt to export a remote object fails. Importantly, `ExportException` can encapsulate numerous low-level, RMI-related exceptions such as `SocketException` or `ObjectException`, thus often acting as an umbrella exception for RMI-related issues.

An `ExportException` typically occurs in two key scenarios:

1. If the `Remote` object fails the export process because it's already been exported to an RMI Runtime.
2. If the `Remote` object isn't acceptable to the RMI Runtime, either due to an incorrect state or wrong argument passed.

## ExportException: Code Demonstration

Here's an example:

```java
try {
    LocateRegistry.createRegistry(1099);
    Object remoteObject = new Object();
    UnicastRemoteObject.exportObject((Remote) remoteObject, 1099);
    System.out.println("Remote object is successfully exported!");
} catch (ExportException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In the above example, we attempted to export a non-Remote object which was incompatible with the RMI Runtime. This yields an `ExportException`.

## In-depth Analysis: Exception Triggers

Understanding the cause is the foremost step in debugging. Let's dissect potential triggers that could possibly result in an `ExportException`.

### 1. Object Already Exported

Java doesn't allow a `Remote` object to be exported more than once. Attempting to do so will result in an `ExportException`. Here is a code example:

```java
try {
    LocateRegistry.createRegistry(1099);
    Hello remoteObject = new Hello();
    UnicastRemoteObject.exportObject(remoteObject, 1099);
    UnicastRemoteObject.exportObject(remoteObject, 1099);
} catch (ExportException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In the above example, exporting the same `Remote` object twice will throw an exception.

### 2. Incorrect Object State

If the object's state isn't ready or appropriate to be passed onto RMI Runtime, an `ExportException` will be thrown. An example might include an object with non-serializable fields.

## How to Fix ExportException?

Now that we understand the basic causes of `ExportException`, let's discuss how we can resolve these issues.

### 1. Ensure Object Uniqueness

Ensure that you don't attempt to export the same Remote object twice. Some frameworks or application servers export the application's Remote objects automatically on startup, so make sure not to unintentionally export again.

```java
try {
    LocateRegistry.createRegistry(1099);
    Hello remoteObject = new Hello();
    UnicastRemoteObject.exportObject(remoteObject, 1099);
    // Don't re-export: UnicastRemoteObject.exportObject(remoteObject, 1099);
} catch (ExportException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

### 2. Validate Object State

Check the state of the Java object before attempting to export it. For example, if you've non-serializable fields in a class which implements `Remote`, consider making them `transient` to ensure the object's readiness for RMI Runtime.

```java
class Hello implements Remote {
    transient NonSerializableObject nsObj;

   // Rest of the class...
}
```

By following these steps, one can resolve the `ExportException`. However, RMI is complex, and you may face additional issues related to networking, security, and advanced object architecture. In these instances, dive deeper into the [Java RMI Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/rmi/RemoteException.html).

Remember, an informed approach to debugging is the key to unlocking effective programming. By understanding the nature and causes of exceptions such as `ExportException`, you can develop more robust, reliable software. 

Happy programming!
