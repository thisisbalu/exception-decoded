Are you trying to remove bugs from your Java applications? If yes, then you might have come across a lot of exceptions messages. One such complex issue is `RMISecurityException`. Developers across the globe are continually struggling to deal with this particular error. This guide will provide you with an in-depth understanding of `RMISecurityException` in Java along with examples and a step-by-step protocol to resolve it. 

## What is RMISecurityException?

The `RMISecurityException` is a checked exception that the Java Runtime Environment (RRE) throws in case an operation within the Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) system fails due to a security violation. 

```java
public class RMISecurityException extends java.lang.SecurityException
```

It’s critical to mention here that `RMISecurityException` is a legacy type that used to be thrown in the time of Java 1.1 when specific operations within the RMI system failed. However, starting from version 1.2, the `Java SecurityManager` rejects such operations directly, and `RMISecurityException` is no longer thrown.

## Common Causes of RMISecurityException

The JVM throws the `RMISecurityException` when the RMI system defines a security manager that does not sanction an action performed by the RMI code. Common examples of such actions include: 

- Trying to load a remote class if the associated class loader disallows it.
- Trying to create a `java.rmi.server.LoaderHandler` instance.
- Establishing or accepting a network connection from an unauthorized source or to a destination.
  
## Understanding & Resolving RMISecurityException

Understanding the cause and knowing how to handle `RMISecurityException` is vital for developers. While the throw of `RMISecurityException` is no longer relevant in newer versions of Java, you might still need to deal with it while working with applications running on older versions. Here’s how you can handle the problem.

```java
try {
    registry.exportObject(remoteReference);
} catch (RMISecurityException ex) {
    System.out.println("Caught an RMISecurityException. Please check your settings.");
    ex.printStackTrace();
}
```

In the code snippet above, the `remoteReference` object is being exported so that clients can make remote method invocations on it. If this operation fails due to a security violation, then the `exportObject` method will throw an `RMISecurityException`. 

Yet, if you're working on an application that runs on a JVM later than version 1.1, then it's a best practice to handle the `SecurityException` directly:

```java
// The general version
try {
    registry.exportObject(remoteReference);
} catch (SecurityException ex) {
    System.out.println("Caught a SecurityException. Please check your settings.");
    ex.printStackTrace();
}
```

## Conclusion

While `RMISecurityException` isn't relevant to developers working with modern versions of Java, understanding it is crucial when maintaining applications running on older JVMs. However, it's vital to remember that the Java Security Manager directly handles security violations related to the RMI system in modern versions, and a `SecurityException` would be thrown instead.

_Public Note_: This discussion only covers the `RMISecurityException` and not the wider topic of Java security. Java security involves intricate features such as the security manager, the bytecode verifier, and the sandbox model. It is recommended to carry out a detailed study for understanding it in its entirety.
