Java, as a robust and versatile programming language, has a myriad of exceptional handling mechanisms. Dealing with exceptions, by understanding and resolving them, significantly makes your programming trajectory smooth sailing. One of the many exceptions that a Java programmer can encounter is the `UnknownTypeException`. Although not commonly seen, it's essential to get a comprehensive understanding of what this exception is and how to resolve it. 

This blog post is your comprehensive guide to the `UnknownTypeException` in Java. We'll introduce you to its concept, how it occurs, and various approaches to fix it.

## What is UnknownTypeException in Java?

The `UnknownTypeException` in the Java language comes into action when an attempt is made to access or modify a variable that has been declared but the type of which is unknown. This exception is a part of the `Java Debug Interface (JDI)` which gives us an unrestricted interface to interact and manipulate the Java virtual machine. It extends the `RuntimeException` and as a result, it need not be declared in a function's or a method's `throws` clause.

Below is a simple declaration of UnknownTypeException in Java:

```
public class UnknownTypeException extends RuntimeException
```

## When Occurs UnknownTypeException?

Let's understand when `UnknownTypeException` occurs with a simple piece of code. 

```java
public class MainClass {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Object x = new Integer(0);
      System.out.println(x);
   }
}
```

In the above code, an Object class instance is created, but the type of the instance is unknown. Hence, when this code runs, it could result in `UnknownTypeException`.

## How to Resolve UnknownTypeException?

In the Java programming language, resolution of exceptions involves two primary steps:

1. Identifying the point of occurrence
2. Amending the source code to handle the exceptions

Let's look at how we can apply these steps to handle `UnknownTypeException`:

```java
public class MainClass {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      try {
         Object x = new Integer(0);
         System.out.println(x);
      } catch (Exception e) {
         e.printStackTrace();
      }
   }
}
```

In the above snippet, we've activated a try-catch block to catch the `UnknownTypeException`. While it is a solution, it might not be the most efficient option. It's essential to fix the root problem â€” which is the type of the variable `x`. Fixing the source code might involve specifying a known type to the variable `x` or proper typecasting. 

```java
public class MainClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       try {
          Integer x = new Integer(0);
          System.out.println(x);
       } catch (Exception e) {
         e.printStackTrace();
       }
    }
}
```

In this program, we have changed the type of `x` from `Object` to `Integer`. Now, the compiler knows that `x` is of `Integer` type. Hence, `UnknownTypeException` will not occur.

## Conclusion

Effectively dealing with exceptions in any programming language saves you a lot of debugging time and can help increase program accuracy manifold. When coding in Java, `UnknownTypeException` can be smoothly resolved by either handling the exception using a try-catch construct or fixing the root cause which is usually due to an undefined type for a declared variable.

Happy Coding!
