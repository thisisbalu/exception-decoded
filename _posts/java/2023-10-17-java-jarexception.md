## Understanding the Java JarException

The Java `JarException` is a subclass of `java.util.zip.ZipException`. It specifically manages exceptions produced by JAR archive errors. While the `ZipException` corresponds to general issues with reading ZIP archives, the `JarException` drills more granular, pointing towards invalid entries when reading JAR (Java Archive) files.

```java
java.util.jar.JarException
```

## Causes of the JarException in Java

One of the primary reasons for `JarException` remains creating a corrupted or invalid JAR file. A `JarException` is thrown when the JAR file's structure doesn't comply with Java specifications. It can range from cases like Entry Size not properly set before writing to the output stream, a failure in reading the next `JarEntry`, or even something as basic as illegal argument by passing `null` to the method that expects a JAR file.

For instance, the below code will throw a `JarException`:

```java
try {
    JarFile jf = new JarFile(null);
} catch(JarException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

## Resolving the JarException with Code Examples

Fixing a `JarException` in Java is a multifaceted approach, depending on the specific cases.

**Case 1: Illegal Argument by passing null**
If the error source is calling a method that expects a JAR file with a `null` argument, the solution is simply passing a valid Jar file.

```java
try {
    JarFile jf = new JarFile("/path/validfile.jar");
} catch(JarException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

**Case 2: Entry Size Not Set**

In another case where the `JarOutputStream` is not set with entry size before writing to the output stream, consider this approach:

```java
try {
    FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("/path/validfile.jar");
    JarOutputStream jos = new JarOutputStream(fos);
    JarEntry je = new JarEntry("test");
    je.setSize(size);  // have to set size
    jos.putNextEntry(je);
    jos.write(data, 0, size);
    jos.closeEntry();
    jos.close();
} catch(JarException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

Take home point, always ensure you set the size of the JAR entry before writing to the `JarOutputStream`.

## Lessons Learned

Understanding how `JarException` in Java works and how to fix this exception is crucial for every Java developer. Even seasoned developers may run into trouble if they incorrectly handle JAR files during their application's runtime. 

## Wrapping It Up

Throughout this guide, we've extensively unraveled the `JarException`, explained why it occurs, and proffered actionable solutions illustrated with code examples. Try to always ensure proper handling of your JAR files and entries to minimize runtime disturbances..
