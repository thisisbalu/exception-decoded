If you're a seasoned or aspiring Java developer, an understanding of `AccessControlException` in Java is overwhelmingly critical to develop secure and robust applications. This guide aims to unravel the complexities related to `AccessControlException`, diving deep into its nitty-gritty and how it is dealt with inside the world of Java.

## What Is AccessControlException?

The `AccessControlException` class belongs to the `java.security` package. This particular exception is thrown when a certain application doesn't have sufficient permission to execute a specific operation. Regardless of whether it is an I/O operation like reading a file or a network operation like establishing a connection, if the required permission for the code is missing, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) will hurl an `AccessControlException`.

## Constructing AccessControlException

The `AccessControlException` class provides two constructors to create an exception object:

```java
// Constructor 1
AccessControlException(String s)

// Constructor 2
AccessControlException(String s, Permission p)
```

Here, `s` is a description of the exception, and `p` is the `Permission` object associated with the denied access.

## How to Handle AccessControlException?

The general rule is that exceptions should be part of the method declaration or caught inside a try-catch block. As `AccessControlException` is an unchecked exception, the Java compiler does not enforce these rules, but it's always prudent to deal with them by employing `try-catch` blocks.

Here is a simple code snippet to handle `AccessControlException`:

```java
try {
	// Code which might throw AccessControlException
} 
catch (AccessControlException ace) {
	System.out.println("Access denied: " + ace.getMessage());
}
```

## Real World Example

Assume you're trying to read a file named "example.txt". If the required permission is missing, the JVM will throw an `AccessControlException`:

```java
try {
	File file = new File("example.txt");
	Scanner reader = new Scanner(file);
	while (reader.hasNextLine()) {
		System.out.println(reader.nextLine());
	}
	reader.close();
} 
catch (AccessControlException ace) {
  System.out.println("Access denied: " + ace.getMessage());
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Always catch an `AccessControlException`.
2. Provide a meaningful message to the `AccessControlException`.
3. Understand the permission requirements for your code. Use the effective `SecurityManager` API to check if a certain `Permission` exists before executing the code.
4. Isolate code that needs special permissions and run it carefully with doPrivileged block.
5. Remember that exception handling should only be used as a recovery mechanism, not as a process for normal flow control.

## Conclusion

Handling exceptions, including `AccessControlException`, is a crucial aspect of developing secure and resilient Java applications. It not only keeps your application safe but also enhances user experience by providing meaningful explanations for a failure scenario. So, never fear exceptions, embrace them by understanding and handling them correctly!
