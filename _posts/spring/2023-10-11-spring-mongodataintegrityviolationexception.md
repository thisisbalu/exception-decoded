Welcome to this comprehensive technical guide about handling the `MongoDataIntegrityViolationException` in Spring Framework. In today's article, we are going to shed light on a critical aspect of Spring web development that can often prove to be a bottleneck for many developers.

## What is MongoDataIntegrityViolationException?
The `MongoDataIntegrityViolationException` is a subtype of `DataAccessException`, thrown by the Spring's Mongo Data Access Object(DAO) when detecting an attempt to violate data integrity constraints. In a more straightforward language, this exception occurs when you try to save or update a document in a way that violates the schema defined on your MongoDB database.

## When does this exception occur?
The `MongoDataIntegrityViolationException` mainly occurs in the following situations:
1. When you are trying to save a `null` value in a field marked as `required`
2. When you are trying to save a document with a duplicate value in a field marked as `unique`
3. Other cases such as exceeding the imposed data length, etc.

Let's look at a hypothetical scenario. You have a `User` document in your MongoDB database, which is defined as follows:

```java
@Document
public class User {
    @Id
    private String id;

    @Indexed(unique = true)
    private String username;
    
    @Indexed(unique = true)
    private String email;

    private String password;
    //...
}
```
In this scenario, if you were to try and save a new `User` instance with an `email` or `username` that already exists in the database, you'd run into a `MongoDataIntegrityViolationException`.

## How to handle the exception?
There are several ways to handle this exception:
1. **Catch the exception**: If you're not sure if a violation will occur, the simplest way to handle the exception is by catching it.

```java
try {
    userRepository.save(user);
} catch (MongoDataIntegrityViolationException e) {
    // Handle exception here
}
```
2. **Preconditions**: If you know the constraints of your data, you can perform checks before attempting a save operation. For instance:

```java
if (userRepository.findByUsername(user.getUsername()) != null) {
    // Handle this case - perhaps by notifying the user that the username is already taken.
} else {
    userRepository.save(user);
}
```
3. **Database-level handling**: An even more robust method is to store some constraints at the database level. We could use MongoDB features like validation rules and partial indexes.

```java
userCollection.createIndex(Indexes.ascending("username"), new IndexOptions().unique(true));
userCollection.createIndex(Indexes.ascending("email"), new IndexOptions().unique(true));
```
Every time we try to save a new user to the MongoDB, the database will automatically check for duplicate username and email.

## Conclusion
Armed with this knowledge, handling `MongoDataIntegrityViolationException` in Spring Framework should be a breeze. Remember, prevention is better than cure. It's always better to proactively avoid these exceptions with pre-validation and mongo-schema constraints rather than catching them.
