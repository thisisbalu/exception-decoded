Are you working with Spring Batch and encountering the SkipLimitExceededException? Don't worry, we've got you covered! In this comprehensive guide, we will walk you through the details of SkipLimitExceededException in Spring, how it works, and how to handle it effectively. So let's dive in!

## What is SkipLimitExceededException?

SkipLimitExceededException is an exception commonly encountered while using Spring Batch, a powerful framework for batch processing in Java applications. It occurs when the maximum number of allowed skips within a batch processing job is exceeded.

In Spring Batch, skips allow for the graceful handling of exceptions during item processing. When an exception occurs while processing an item, it can be skipped to prevent the entire batch job from failing. A SkipLimitExceededException is thrown when the number of skips exceeds the configured limit, indicating that the job could not execute successfully due to too many failed items.

## How Does SkipLimitExceededException Work?

To better understand SkipLimitExceededException, let's take a look at a typical scenario using Spring Batch:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableBatchProcessing
public class BatchConfiguration {
    
    @Autowired
    private JobBuilderFactory jobBuilderFactory;
    
    @Autowired
    private StepBuilderFactory stepBuilderFactory;
    
    @Bean
    public Step myStep(ItemReader<MyItem> itemReader, ItemProcessor<MyItem, MyItem> itemProcessor, ItemWriter<MyItem> itemWriter) {
        return stepBuilderFactory.get("myStep")
                .<MyItem, MyItem>chunk(10)
                .reader(itemReader)
                .processor(itemProcessor)
                .writer(itemWriter)
                .faultTolerant()
                .skipLimit(5)
                .skip(Exception.class)
                .build();
    }
    
    @Bean
    public Job myJob(Step myStep) {
        return jobBuilderFactory.get("myJob")
                .incrementer(new RunIdIncrementer())
                .start(myStep)
                .build();
    }
}
```

In the above code snippet, we define a batch configuration with a step named "myStep". The faultTolerant() method enables fault tolerance, allowing skipped items in case of exceptions. The skipLimit(5) sets the maximum number of allowed skips to 5.

When an exception occurs during item processing within the step, it is caught and logged by default. If the number of skipped items exceeds the skip limit, a SkipLimitExceededException is thrown, indicating that the job could not be executed successfully due to excessive failures.

## Handling SkipLimitExceededException

Handling SkipLimitExceededException depends on the specific requirements of your job and the desired behavior when the skip limit is exceeded. Here are a few approaches to consider:

### 1. Retry Failed Items

Instead of allowing the job to fail immediately when the skip limit is exceeded, you can configure Spring Batch to retry the failed items a certain number of times. This can be achieved by integrating a retry mechanism, such as using Spring Retry, and configuring it as follows:

```java
@Bean
public Step myStep(ItemReader<MyItem> itemReader, ItemProcessor<MyItem, MyItem> itemProcessor, ItemWriter<MyItem> itemWriter) {
    return stepBuilderFactory.get("myStep")
            .<MyItem, MyItem>chunk(10)
            .reader(itemReader)
            .processor(itemProcessor)
            .writer(itemWriter)
            .faultTolerant()
            .skipLimit(5)
            .skip(Exception.class)
            .retryLimit(3)
            .backOffPolicy(new ExponentialBackOffPolicy())
            .build();
}
```

By setting a retry limit (e.g., 3) and applying a back-off policy (e.g., ExponentialBackOffPolicy), failed items will be retried up to the specified retry limit. This approach provides more chances for problematic items to succeed without exceeding the skip limit.

### 2. Stop Job Execution

If the skip limit is critical to your business logic and you want to halt the job execution when it exceeds, you can catch the SkipLimitExceededException explicitly and take appropriate action. Here's an example:

```java
@Bean
public Step myStep(ItemReader<MyItem> itemReader, ItemProcessor<MyItem, MyItem> itemProcessor, ItemWriter<MyItem> itemWriter) {
    return stepBuilderFactory.get("myStep")
            .<MyItem, MyItem>chunk(10)
            .reader(itemReader)
            .processor(itemProcessor)
            .writer(itemWriter)
            .faultTolerant()
            .skipLimit(5)
            .skip(Exception.class)
            .build()
            .listener(new SkipLimitListener());
}

public class SkipLimitListener implements SkipListener<MyItem, MyItem> {

    @Override
    public void onSkipInProcess(MyItem item, Throwable t) {
        if (t instanceof SkipLimitExceededException) {
            // Perform any necessary action, e.g., logging, notification, etc.
            // You may choose to stop job execution explicitly at this point.
        }
    }

    // Implement other SkipListener methods as per your requirement
    
}
```

By implementing a SkipListener and overriding the onSkipInProcess() method, you can handle the SkipLimitExceededException separately and perform any necessary actions, such as logging or notifying concerned parties. Depending on your decision, you might stop the job execution explicitly to prevent further processing.

### 3. Configure Skip Policy

In some cases, you may want to define a custom skip policy to selectively skip items based on specific conditions. Spring Batch allows you to implement and configure a SkipPolicy as follows:

```java
@Bean
public Step myStep(ItemReader<MyItem> itemReader, ItemProcessor<MyItem, MyItem> itemProcessor, ItemWriter<MyItem> itemWriter) {
    return stepBuilderFactory.get("myStep")
            .<MyItem, MyItem>chunk(10)
            .reader(itemReader)
            .processor(itemProcessor)
            .writer(itemWriter)
            .faultTolerant()
            .skipLimit(5)
            .skipPolicy(new MySkipPolicy())
            .build();
}

public class MySkipPolicy implements SkipPolicy {

    @Override
    public boolean shouldSkip(Throwable t, int skipCount) throws SkipLimitExceededException {
        // Custom logic to determine if the item should be skipped or not
        return skipCount < 5;
    }
}
```

By implementing the SkipPolicy interface and overriding the shouldSkip() method, you can define custom logic to determine which exceptions should be skipped and how many times they can be skipped. This approach provides fine-grained control over the item skipping process.
