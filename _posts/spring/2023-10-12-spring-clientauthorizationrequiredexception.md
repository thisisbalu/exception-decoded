When working with the Spring framework, a paradigm shift often emerges. You start to transition from just coding away to attempting to unravel the nuances of individual exceptions and exploring the entire ecosystem of Spring. In this article, we will scrape off the plight of the `ClientAuthorizationRequiredException` encountered in Spring Security OAuth2.

The `ClientAuthorizationRequiredException` typically gets thrown when an OAuth 2.0 authorization request is being executed by the OAuth2 client but no current client authorization is available. It signifies a missing prerequisite before an OAuth2 client can perform certain tasks.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Java programming language
- Familiarity with the Spring framework
- Understanding of OAuth2

## Understanding the ClientAuthorizationRequiredException

In Spring Security, the `ClientAuthorizationRequiredException` is essentially the barrier thrown by the OAuth2 client while trying to make an authorization request with no client authorization available.

Here’s a sneak peek at a typical `ClientAuthorizationRequiredException`:

```Java
org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.ClientAuthorizationRequiredException: [authorization_request_not_found] An authorization request could not be found with the provided Client Identifier and Authorization Grant Type
```
It implies the absence of an authorization request with the given client identifier and the defined grant type. 

Let's now delve into where this exception may arise.

## Situational Appearance of the Exception

Consider this Spring Boot Security implementation:

```Java
@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig extends SecurityFilterChain {

    SecurityConfig(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.oauth2Login()
                .clientRegistrationRepository(this.clientRegistrationRepository())
                .authorizedClientRepository(this.authorizedClientRepository());
    }

    @Bean
    public InMemoryClientRegistrationRepository clientRegistrationRepository() {
        //Client configuration here
    }

    @Bean
    public InMemoryOAuth2AuthorizedClientService authorizedClientRepository() {
        // Authorized client service configuration here
    }
}
```
In the configuration above, the chances for `ClientAuthorizationRequiredException` to get triggered are increased if the implementation for `clientRegistrationRepository()` and `authorizedClientRepository()` is improper or inadequate thereby resulting in no client authorizations available during OAuth2 authentication.
 
## Mitigating the Exception

One of the most effective ways to handle this exception is via the `OAuth2AuthorizationFailureHandler`. This interface suits the role as it is designed to handle OAuth2 authorization-related failures.

Here's an example:

```Java
@Component
public class CustomOAuth2AuthorizationFailureHandler extends OAuth2AuthorizationFailureHandler {
  
    @Override
    public void onAuthorizationFailure(AuthorizationFailure failure, HttpServletRequest request, 
                                       HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {
        if (failure instanceof ClientAuthorizationRequiredException) {
            String redirectionUri = "/oauth2/authorization/" +
                                    ((ClientAuthorizationRequiredException) failure).
                                    getClientRegistrationId();
            redirectStrategy.sendRedirect(request, response, redirectionUri);
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, the custom failure handler checks if the `AuthorizationFailure` is an instance of `ClientAuthorizationRequiredException`, and if it's the case, it redirects to the authorization request path.
 

## Tips to Avoid the Exception

1. **Correct Client Configuration**: Ensure that you’ve correctly set up the OAuth2 clients in your Spring Boot application.

2. **Use OAuth2AuthorizedClientService**: Implement `OAuth2AuthorizedClientService` to store authorized client information since it manages authorized OAuth2 clients between requests.

3. **Customize Failure Handler:** Craft a custom authorization failure handler to manage how your application should react when such exceptions occur.

## Wrapping Up

Now that you have an understanding of what triggers a `ClientAuthorizationRequiredException` and how to tame it, your journey with Spring Security would be a little less complicated. Remember, exceptions are not a catastrophe; they’re only road signs that guide us towards the correct solution.
