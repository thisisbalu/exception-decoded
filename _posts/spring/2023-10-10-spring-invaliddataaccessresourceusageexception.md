If you have ever worked with the Spring framework, chances are you might have come across exceptions that can be quite confusing. One of these exceptions is InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException. Understanding what this means can help you troubleshoot and resolve the issues faster. In this guide, we'll delve deeply into this specific exception and provide some real-world examples on how to handle and resolve it.

## The InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException

Generally, when using the Spring Data JPA, developers might encounter the InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException. This exception is a subclass of `NonTransientDataAccessException` and is thrown when an invalid Data Access Resource Usage is found. This typically implies that there is an error in your SQL syntax or in its mapping relationship.

## Why Does It Occur?

The InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException usually occurs due to the following reasons:

- Incorrect SQL syntax: The SQL statement used to communicate with the database might be incorrect.
- Problems with the mapping relationship: The mapping relationship between the SQL query and the data model may not match, leading to this exception.
- Issues with the schema: The Database schema might have been modified, and the SQL query is no longer valid.

Let's assume a basic example to illustrate this:

```java
@Entity
public class Employee {
   @Id
   @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
   private Long id;
   
   private String name;
   
   // Other properties and getters & setters
}
```
And a simple JPA repository like:

```java
public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository<Employee, Long> {
   Employee findByName(String name);
}
```

This will result in an `InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException` if the column `name` does not exist in the corresponding `employee` table in the database.

## How Can It Be Resolved?

To resolve this exception, you will need to debug your code and pinpoint where the error lies. Here are some ways through which you can resolve this:

### 1. Check Syntax:
Make sure that your SQL statement is syntactically correct. Keep a close watch on names, keywords, aliases, etc.

### 2. Cross-check Mapping Relationships:
This implies checking if the mapping between the variable in the data model and column in the database table is correct.

```java
@Entity
public class Employee {
   // Mapped to "name" column in "employee" table in DB
   @Column(name = "name")
   private String empName;

   // Other properties, getters & setters
}
```

### 3. Verify Database Schema:
If your schema has changed, ensure to reflect those changes in your SQL statement or JPA model.

In essence, resolving an `InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException` involves making sure your SQL syntax, mapping relationships, and database schema are all in the correct order.

## Best Practices

Establish sound practices when writing your queries and mapping your entity relationships to ensure that you avoid potential exceptions. Here are some common guidelines:
- Use the correct casing for table and column names.
- Define relationships properly in your JPA models.
- Always keep your JPA models and the database schema in sync.

## Conclusion

Handling exceptions is a crucial skill in software development. This guide is an attempt to help you in resolving one of those tricky ones - the InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException in Spring framework. Always ensure to check your SQL syntax, cross-verify your mapping, and keep an eye out for any modifications in your database schema. Practice good coding standards, and bear in mind that bug-free code is rarely an accident; it's a result of careful planning, testing, and debugging.
