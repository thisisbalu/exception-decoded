Welcome to a deep-dive article into one of the tidbits of Spring framework, the `InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException`. The objective of this article is to unpack the subject, as well as sharing a couple of useful coding best practices to manage this exception in your Spring application. 

Before diving in, it is crucial to highlight that by understanding this exception, you’ll be enhancing your grasp over data access layer in Spring, hence further improving your ability to build robust, enterprise-grade applications.

Let's not beat around the bush, let's get coding!

## An Overview of InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException

In the Spring framework, `InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException` is an unchecked exception that typically indicates a resource failure specific to the particular Data Access Resource that we are using. This could be due to incorrect usage of an API, or failure to meet API’s contract – possibly violation of database constraints, incorrect SQL statements, etc.

Let us dig a bit deeper into the hierarchy of this exception:

```java
java.lang.RuntimeException
    org.springframework.core.NestedRuntimeException
        org.springframework.dao.DataAccessException
            org.springframework.dao.NonTransientDataAccessException
                org.springframework.dao.InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException
```

By understanding this hierarchy, it becomes easier to catch and handle this specific exception.

## When Does It Occur?

The `InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException` typically arises because of incorrect resource usage, e.g., when we use a wrong SQL query. It doesn't signify a connection failure as such. Exceptions due to Resource usage failure are typically not recoverable, and do not require a system restart.

Here is the code snippet that demonstrates a case where this exception could be thrown:

```java
try{
    String sql = "SELECT * FORM users"; //incorrect SQL
    List<Map<String, Object>> rows = getJdbcTemplate().queryForList(sql);
} catch(InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException ex){
    // handle the exception
}
```

In the above piece of code, the SQL statement is incorrect, and hence, the `InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException` would be thrown.

## Handling InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException

Since the `InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException` is a runtime exception, you have the option not to handle it. But, as a best practice, it is recommended to handle it, thereby making the code more robust.

A sample code to handle this exception may look like:

```java
try {
    // DB operation
} catch (InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException e) {
    log.error("InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException: {}", e.getMessage());
    // Perform exception handling
} 
```

## Conclusion

The handling of `InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException` is a small aspect of the overall Spring ecosystem, but mastering each aspect strengthens your command over the framework. In this article, we've understood the `InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException`, its causes, and how to handle it. 

Spring Framework offers a vast array of powerful features, and handling of data access exceptions is only a small (but important) part of it. Explore the myriad features and functionality provided by Spring to develop robust and scalable enterprise applications.
