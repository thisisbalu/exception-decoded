*Learn how to handle the ResourceNotFoundException in Spring framework*

Introduction:
- What is Spring framework?
- What is ResourceNotFoundException?

What is Spring framework?
------------------------------
[Spring framework](https://spring.io/) is a powerful and widely used Java-based framework that provides a comprehensive infrastructure for developing enterprise-level web applications. It offers many features and modules that simplify the development process and promote good coding practices.

What is ResourceNotFoundException?
----------------------------------------------
In Spring, **ResourceNotFoundException** is a runtime exception that occurs when an application fails to find a requested resource, such as a file, database entry, or any other resource required to fulfill a request. This exception is often thrown when trying to retrieve or access resources that are missing or unavailable.

Common Causes of ResourceNotFoundException:
- Incorrect file paths or resource locations
- Database connection issues
- External service endpoints not reachable
- Inconsistent data or deleted resources

ResourceNotFoundException in Spring:
---------------------------------------------
Spring provides various ways to handle and gracefully respond to a **ResourceNotFoundException** scenario. Let's explore some of the best practices for dealing with this exception.

### 1. Using @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler Annotations
In Spring, you can utilize the `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler` annotations to handle exceptions globally or for specific controllers. By creating a custom exception handler class and annotating it with `@ControllerAdvice`, you can centralize and manage all exceptions of a specific type.

Here's an example of handling a ResourceNotFoundException using `@ControllerAdvice`:

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class ResourceNotFoundHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleResourceNotFoundException(ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
        // Custom error response or redirect logic
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND).body(ex.getMessage());
    }
}
```

### 2. Custom Exception Handling with ResponseEntity
In some cases, you may want to have more control over the handling of a ResourceNotFoundException. By using the `ResponseEntity` class, you can customize the response status, headers, and body.

```java
@GetMapping("/resources/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<Resource> getResource(@PathVariable Long id) {
    Resource resource = resourceService.getResourceById(id);
    if (resource == null) {
        throw new ResourceNotFoundException("Resource not found with ID: " + id);
    }
    return ResponseEntity.ok(resource);
}

@ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
public ResponseEntity<String> handleResourceNotFoundException(ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
    return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND).body(ex.getMessage());
}
```

### 3. Custom Error Response DTOs
To provide more informative error responses, you can create custom Data Transfer Objects (DTOs). These DTOs allow you to design error responses that provide additional details about the exception, such as error codes, timestamps, or stack traces.

```java
public class ErrorResponse {

    private int statusCode;
    private String message;
    private long timestamp;

    // constructor, getters, setters
}

@ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleResourceNotFoundException(ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
    ErrorResponse error = new ErrorResponse();
    error.setStatusCode(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND.value());
    error.setMessage(ex.getMessage());
    error.setTimestamp(System.currentTimeMillis());
    return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND).body(error);
}
```

Conclusion:
---------------
Handling the ResourceNotFoundException is crucial for building robust and user-friendly applications. By implementing the approaches discussed above, you can effectively handle these exceptions and provide meaningful feedback to users when a resource is not found.

In this article, we covered three methods to handle ResourceNotFoundException in Spring:

1. Using `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler` Annotations
2. Custom Exception Handling with ResponseEntity
3. Custom Error Response DTOs

By following these best practices, you can ensure your Spring application gracefully handles missing resources and provides clear and helpful error messages to users.
