Software developers use the Spring Framework because of its portable and efficient nature. In particular, developers use the Spring Framework's data access and transaction management features when working with MongoDB because it fosters consistency and improves productivity. However, a common challenge that Spring Framework users often come across is the `MongoTransactionException`. 

This daunting exception might stump a lot of developers. This tutorial aims to provide in-depth insight into what it is, why it occurs, and elucidates strategies to deal with this issue in the Spring Framework. This article is a guide that targets developers who already have basic knowledge about Spring Framework and MongoDB.

## What Exactly is a `MongoTransactionException`?

Before we delve into the nits and grits of troubleshooting and resolving this issue, it's important to understand what a `MongoTransactionException` is. `MongoTransactionException` is a runtime exception that represents all possible failures associated with MongoDB's transactions in Spring Data MongoDB.

```
try {
    ...
} catch (MongoTransactionException e) {
    // perform exception handling here
}
```

## Understand the Cause of `MongoTransactionException`

Most commonly, this exception occurs when you are trying to perform transactions in a MongoDB cluster that is not sharded. This may also happen when working with read preferences other than primary.

Transactional support in MongoDB was only introduced in v4.0 for replica sets and for sharded clusters in v4.2. If your MongoDB server version is older than that, then transactions are not supported, and trying to perform transactions will lead to `MongoTransactionException`.

## Possible Solutions to Overcome `MongoTransactionException`

There are few strategies to deal with `MongoTransactionException`. 

### 1. Upgrade MongoDB Version

The first one is the most straightforward approach: upgrade your MongoDB server to version 4.0 or later. You'll also need to make sure that you're using a MongoClient that supports transactions. Here's a brief code snippet illustrating how to use MongoClient:

```java
MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create("mongodb://<host>:<port>");
MongoDatabase database = mongoClient.getDatabase("test");
database.runCommand(new Document("startTransaction", new Document()));
```

### 2. Using MongoDB Sharded Cluster 

Another way to overcome `MongoTransactionException` is to switch to MongoDB sharded cluster if you haven't already.

```java
ShardKeyPattern shardKeyPattern = new ShardKeyPattern(Document.parse("{ 'field' : 1}"));
mongoClient.getDatabase("<database>").runCommand(new Document("shardCollection", "<database>.<collection>").append("key", shardKeyPattern.toDocument()));
```

Remember to replace `<database>` and `<collection>` with your actual database and collection names, respectively.

### 3. Specify Appropriate Read and Write Concerns

If you're already working with MongoDB 4.0 or later and using transactions, but still encountering `MongoTransactionException`, try specifying the correct read and write preferences. Transactions need a `read preference` of `primary` and a `write concern` of `majority`. Here's an example of how to specify the read and write preferences in Spring.

```java
MongoTemplate mongoTemplate = new MongoTemplate(mongoClient, "<database>");
mongoTemplate.setReadPreference(ReadPreference.primary());
mongoTemplate.setWriteConcern(WriteConcern.MAJORITY);
```

This ensures that all read and write operations within a session are sent to the primary member of the replica set.

## Conclusion

While the Spring Framework boasts a suite of tools for efficient software development, the `MongoTransactionException` can pose tough debugging challenges. Understanding why this exception happens and being equipped with how to deal with it, definitely facilitates smoother development when working with Spring and MongoDB. 

As always, ensure that you test your applications rigorously before deployment into production, as failing to capture such exceptions can lead to system instability and a poor user experience.

Remember, the goal isn't to avoid exceptions, but the ability to effectively handle them when they occur. The strategies mentioned in this guide can surely help you overcome the dreaded `MongoTransactionException` during your Spring-MongoDB journey.
