Spring Framework, a robust platform for building Java applications, offers an extensive infrastructure support for the development of robust and high-performing web applications. Just like any other programming environment, it has its shares of exceptions and intricacies. Today, we'll dig into one such exception: `UnableToSendNotificationException`.

This insidious exception often rears its head in Spring applications when there are issues with notification sending capabilities. To effectively tackle this issue, it is important to understand the cause, how to identify it and potential fixes. 

## Understanding `UnableToSendNotificationException`

The `UnableToSendNotificationException` usually ensues when the Spring application is unable to send a Spring-specific event notification. Spring facilitates an event-driven model where components within the application can publish and listen to events - enabling a loose coupling between the application components.

Usually, the message attached with this exception provides an insight into the root cause of the problem. The most common reasons could be an issue in the event publication workflow or a failure of a listener handling the event.

For instance, an application may throw `UnableToSendNotificationException` with the error message:

```java
org.springframework.core.env.config.app:
UnableToSendNotificationException: Failure to send a notification for complete event.
```
This might occur when a listener fails to process an event.

## Identifying `UnableToSendNotificationException` 

Consider the following example where we define an event and its respective listener:

```java
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationEvent;

public class CustomEvent extends ApplicationEvent {
    public CustomEvent(Object source) {
        super(source);
    }
}

...

import org.springframework.context.event.EventListener;

public class CustomEventListener {
    @EventListener
    public void handleCustomEvent(CustomEvent event) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Exception in event listener");
    }
}
```
In this case, an exception in the listener's `handleCustomEvent` method when handling `CustomEvent` could potentially result in `UnableToSendNotificationException`.

## Resolving `UnableToSendNotificationException`

The solution to this exception largely depends on the cause. It might require fixing the faulty listener, adjusting the event wiring, or even checking the event publisher.

In the above case, the exception handling within the event listener code would resolve the problem.

```java
import org.springframework.context.event.EventListener;

public class CustomEventListener {
    @EventListener
    public void handleCustomEvent(CustomEvent event) {
        try {
            // Code that might throw exception
        } catch(RuntimeException re) {
            // Log the error and handle exception
        }
    }
}
```
This way, the event listener can handle potential runtime exceptions, thereby preventing the entire notification workflow from being disrupted. 

## Conclusion

The `UnableToSendNotificationException` is a unique issue in the Spring ecosystem that revolves around the event-driven system. Ensuring well-designed event listeners, robust error handling, and efficient event wiring can aid in mitigating this exception. Remember, a carefully architected system won't just prevent exceptions like `UnableToSendNotificationException`, but it'll make your whole application more reliable too!

Glitches like this can be daunting, but that's the beauty of working in an ever-evolving technology landscape. It's through solving these challenges, do we grow and learn. Keep coding, keep debugging!
