Hello savvy coders! Today, we venture down the beautiful yet complex road that is Spring Framework. Specifically, we're here to decode a common hiccough often faced by Spring developers: **FieldErrors**. Our voyage through this information-packed resource will help you debunk, dissect and deftly handle FieldErrors in your Spring applications, ensuring smooth sailing for your Spring projects.

## Understanding FieldError: What's in a Name?

FieldError is an intriguing concept in terms of Spring Framework's error handling. Derived from the `ObjectError` class, `FieldError` is a sub-class encompassing field-specific error within the application. It bears three fundamental properties: **object name**, **field**, and **default message**. 

Let's identify each one:

- `ObjectName` - Represents the name of the object that the FieldError is associated with.
- `Field` - Indicates the concerning field that triggered the error.
- `DefaultMessage` - Depicts a default message detailing the error that has occurred.

A simple way to understand the construct of a FieldError is:

```java
FieldError error = new FieldError("objectName", "field", "defaultMessage");
```

## When Something Goes Wrong: Encountering FieldError

In Spring, FieldErrors typically occur during the binding process, where fields of a form are tied with the respective properties of a bean. If something goes awry during this binding phase, a FieldError crops up!

For instance, consider a scenario where you have a `User` class with a field `email`. If someone tries to fill a form without providing an email, you may encounter a FieldError:

```java
if (bindingResult.hasErrors()) {
    FieldError fieldError = bindingResult.getFieldError();
    System.out.println(fieldError.getField());
    System.out.println(fieldError.getDefaultMessage());
}
```
(just an illustrative example, actual handling may differ)

## Exception Handling to the Rescue

Exception handling is an indispensable tool when dealing with errors in coding. Let's see how you can handle FieldErrors using Spring's structured exception handling:

```java
public String saveUser(@Valid User user, BindingResult bindingResult) {

    if(bindingResult.hasErrors()) {
        List<FieldError> errors = bindingResult.getFieldErrors();
        for (FieldError error : errors ) {
            System.out.println (error.getObjectName() + " - " + error.getDefaultMessage());
        }
       
     /* Add your business logic here */
    }
   
   /* Add code to save user details */
}
```
This is a simple yet effective way to handle FieldErrors within your Spring application.

## Domain Your Own Custom Handling

You don't necessitate sticking to the default handling provided by Spring. Personalize error handling as per your needs:

```java
public String saveUser(@Valid User user, BindingResult bindingResult) {

   if(bindingResult.hasErrors()) {
        Map<String, String> errorsMap = bindingResult.getFieldErrors().stream()
          .collect(Collectors.toMap(FieldError::getField, FieldError::getDefaultMessage));
  
        throw new YourOwnCustomException(errorsMap);
   }
   
   /* Add code to save user details */
}
```
With this, you can create detailed, more purpose-specific exceptions to troubleshoot and rectify your FieldErrors more efficiently.

## Conclusion

FieldError in Spring Framework might seem daunting, but with a little dedication and the right understanding, you can master all things FieldError. So, the next time a FieldError crops up in your application, you'll be equipped to understand, handle, and debug it effectively!
