Let's dive into understanding a rather fascinating exception encountered in the Spring Boot framework, suitably known as the `PatchException`. 

Being conversant with Spring Boot comes in handy when dealing with modern-day Java applications. Whether you're a veteran or rookie in Java, facing exceptions like the `PatchException` is common. However, fret not! In this guide, we'll arm you with all the necessary knowledge to effectively handle and fix it.

Please note that this guide assumes you possess foundational knowledge concerning the Spring Boot framework.

## Understanding PatchException

The `PatchException` is a type of exception encountered when using the PATCH HTTP method. This method is typically used in updating the partial properties of a resource residing on the server. However, if not appropriately executed, it can lead to a `PatchException`.

```java
throw new PatchException("Could not find entity with id " + id);
```

## Causes of PatchException

Patch operations predominantly require updating a portion of a resource. Hence, the failure to find an item needed for the update triggers the `PatchException`.

However, it's important to understand that the PATCH method behaves differently from other HTTP methods like POST, PUT, and DELETE. So let's delve into understanding the PATCH method correctly.

## Understanding and Implementing HTTP PATCH Verb

Unlike POST and PUT where the complete updated JSON is required, PATCH only needs the specific parts that need modifications.

Here's a basic PATCH request example using `RestTemplate`:

```java
HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
headers.setContentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);
HttpEntity<String> request = new HttpEntity<>(patchBody, headers);

RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
restTemplate.exchange(
    url, HttpMethod.PATCH, request, Void.class);
```

For a Spring RESTful service, you can define a PATCH endpoint as follows:

```java
@RequestMapping(value = "/students/{id}", method = RequestMethod.PATCH)
public ResponseEntity<Object> updateStudent(@RequestBody Student student, @PathVariable("id") String id) {
   
    // business logic here

    return new ResponseEntity<>("Student is updated successfully", HttpStatus.OK);
}
```

## The Solution: Resolving PatchException

To effectively solve the `PatchException`, a defensive programming approach is recommended. This involves checking if the id provided exists in the database before any PATCH operation. If the id doesn't exist, an understandable message should be passed to the client, instead of throwing the `PatchException`.

Here's an example:

```java
Optional<Student> existingStudent = studentRepository.findById(id);

if (!existingStudent.isPresent()) {
    return new ResponseEntity<>("Student with id " + id + " does not exist.", HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
}
// Else, proceed with the PATCH operation

//business logic here

return new ResponseEntity<>("Student is updated successfully", HttpStatus.OK);
```

By making this small amendment, you can control the `PatchException` and gracefully handle it.

## Conclusion

In this walk-through, we succinctly explored the causes and solutions of `PatchException` while working with Spring Boot. Remember, efficient exception handling is a crucial part of writing robust, scalable, and dashingly good code.

Let's keep exploring and enhancing our knowledge, one exception at a time!
