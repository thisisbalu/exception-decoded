## 1. Understanding `ConversionNotSupportedException`

The Spring framework provides robust support for JavaBeans via its `BeanWrapper` infrastructure. This infrastructure enables property-level manipulation of objects, handling conversions between different types. 

However, there are situations where Spring might throw a `ConversionNotSupportedException`. This exception typically indicates that the conversion between two types is not supported or cannot be performed by the underlying implementation.

## 2. Why does `ConversionNotSupportedException` occur?

`ConversionNotSupportedException` occurs when Spring fails to convert a given value into its desired target type. This can happen due to several reasons, including:

- Missing or misconfigured converters or conversion services.
- Incompatible types, where the conversion is not possible or doesn't make sense.
- Incorrect configuration when performing a custom conversion.

It is crucial to note that Spring's `ConversionService` makes use of `Converter` implementations to perform the necessary type conversions. If a required converter is missing or misconfigured, a `ConversionNotSupportedException` may be thrown.

## 3. Handling `ConversionNotSupportedException`

When encountering a `ConversionNotSupportedException`, several options are available for handling the situation. 

### a. Implementing Custom Converters

One approach is to implement custom converters for the problematic types. By implementing the `Converter` interface, you can define your conversion logic and register the converter with the `ConversionService`. This ensures that Spring can perform the required conversion.

Here's an example of a custom converter for converting `String` to `LocalDate`:

```java
public class StringToLocalDateConverter implements Converter<String, LocalDate> {
    @Override
    public LocalDate convert(String source) {
        // Perform the conversion logic
        return LocalDate.parse(source);
    }
}
```

### b. Configuring ConversionService

Another option is to configure the `ConversionService` with the necessary converters. This could involve registering the converters manually or leveraging Spring's auto-configured `DefaultConversionService`.

To add a converter manually, you can use the `ConversionServiceFactoryBean` and define your custom converters within the `converters` property:

```java
@Configuration
public class ConversionConfig {

    @Bean
    public ConversionService conversionService() {
        ConversionServiceFactoryBean factoryBean = new ConversionServiceFactoryBean();
        factoryBean.setConverters(Set.of(new StringToLocalDateConverter()));
        factoryBean.afterPropertiesSet();
        return factoryBean.getObject();
    }
}
```

### c. Configuring Spring MVC

If the `ConversionNotSupportedException` occurs within the Spring MVC framework, you can configure a `WebDataBinder` with a custom conversion service. This is achieved by extending the `WebMvcConfigurer` interface and overriding the `addFormatters` method:

```java
@Configuration
public class WebMvcConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {

    @Override
    public void addFormatters(FormatterRegistry registry) {
        registry.addConverter(new StringToLocalDateConverter());
    }
}
```

## 4. Code Examples

Now, let's dive into a couple of code examples to showcase how `ConversionNotSupportedException` can be encountered and resolved.

### Example 1: ConversionNotSupportedException in Bean Creation

```java
public class MyBean {

    private LocalDate date;

    public LocalDate getDate() {
        return date;
    }

    public void setDate(LocalDate date) {
        this.date = date;
    }
}
```

```java
public class MyApp {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConfigurableApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
        MyBean myBean = context.getBean(MyBean.class);
        myBean.setDate("2022-07-01");     // Potential ConversionNotSupportedException
    }
}
```

In this example, the `setDate` method of `MyBean` expects a `LocalDate` object, but we are providing a `String`. Without proper conversion configuration, a `ConversionNotSupportedException` will be thrown.

### Example 2: Custom Conversion Service Setup

```java
@Configuration
public class ConversionConfig {

    @Bean
    public ConversionService conversionService() {
        DefaultConversionService conversionService = new DefaultConversionService();
        conversionService.addConverter(new StringToLocalDateConverter());
        return conversionService;
    }
}
```

In this example, we configure a custom `ConversionService` bean by adding our `StringToLocalDateConverter`. This enables Spring to handle conversions between `String` and `LocalDate`.

## 5. Conclusion

The `ConversionNotSupportedException` in Spring can be challenging to deal with, but armed with the knowledge gained from this article, you're now better equipped to handle it effectively. Remember to identify the cause of the exception and choose the appropriate approach, whether it's implementing custom converters, configuring the conversion service, or updating the setup within Spring MVC.

By leveraging the power of Spring's conversion framework, you can overcome conversion challenges and ensure smooth data transformations within your applications.
