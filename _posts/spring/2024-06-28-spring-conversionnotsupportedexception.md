> Discover how to handle `ConversionNotSupportedException` in Spring when using custom data types.

## Introduction

In any software application, handling exceptions is crucial for ensuring a smooth user experience and preventing unexpected crashes. When working with Spring, a popular Java framework, it's essential to understand how to handle exceptions effectively. One such exception we'll explore in this article is the `ConversionNotSupportedException`.

## What is ConversionNotSupportedException?

The `ConversionNotSupportedException` is a specific exception that is thrown when an attempt to convert a value from one type to another is not supported by the underlying conversion mechanism. This commonly occurs when working with custom data types in Spring.

## Understanding ConversionService

Before diving into how to handle `ConversionNotSupportedException`, it's vital to understand the role of the `ConversionService` interface. Spring's `ConversionService` provides a simple API for converting between types, allowing developers to implement converters for their custom types.

## Handling ConversionNotSupportedException

To handle the `ConversionNotSupportedException` in Spring, we can follow a few methods:

### 1. ExceptionHandler Annotation

Spring provides the `@ExceptionHandler` annotation, which allows us to define a method to handle a specific exception. To handle `ConversionNotSupportedException`, we can create a method annotated with `@ExceptionHandler` within a `@ControllerAdvice` class.

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class CustomExceptionHandler {
  
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST)
    @ExceptionHandler(ConversionNotSupportedException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleConversionNotSupportedException(ConversionNotSupportedException ex) {
        // Custom error handling logic
        return ResponseEntity.badRequest().body("Error: Conversion not supported");
    }
}
```

In the above code snippet, the `@ResponseStatus` annotation sets the HTTP status code, and the `@ExceptionHandler` annotation indicates that this method should handle `ConversionNotSupportedException`. We can then customize the error message as needed.

### 2. Custom ConversionService

Another approach is to create a custom implementation of the `ConversionService` interface. By implementing the `ConversionService` interface, we can provide our own conversion logic for the unsupported types.

```java
public class CustomConversionService implements ConversionService {
 
    // Other methods ...
    
    @Override
    public <T> T convert(Object source, TypeDescriptor sourceType, TypeDescriptor targetType) throws ConversionException {
        throw new ConversionNotSupportedException(source, sourceType.getType(), targetType.getType(), null);
    }
}
```

In this example, we throw a `ConversionNotSupportedException` if the conversion is not supported. This allows us to catch the exception at a higher level and handle it accordingly.

### 3. Error Handling in Rest Controllers

When building RESTful APIs with Spring, we can handle the `ConversionNotSupportedException` in the controller itself by using the `@ExceptionHandler` annotation.

```java
@RestController
public class UserController {
    
    // Other methods ...
    
    @ExceptionHandler(ConversionNotSupportedException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleConversionNotSupportedException(ConversionNotSupportedException ex) {
        return ResponseEntity.badRequest().body("Error: Conversion not supported");
    }
}
```

By adding the `@ExceptionHandler` annotation with the corresponding exception type, we can handle the exception and provide an appropriate response.

## Conclusion

The `ConversionNotSupportedException` is an important exception to handle when working with custom data types in Spring. By using the techniques discussed in this article, we can ensure graceful exception handling in our applications, leading to better user experiences and increased robustness.

For more information, you can refer to the official Spring documentation on [Handling Exceptions](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web.html#mvc-ann-exceptionhandler) and [ConversionService](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html#core-convert).
