Have you ever come across the `MutuallyExclusiveConfigurationPropertiesException` in Spring? This exception is thrown when you try to configure multiple properties that are considered mutually exclusive. In this article, we will explore what this exception is, when it occurs, and how to avoid it. So, let's dive in and understand this exception in detail.

## What is the MutuallyExclusiveConfigurationPropertiesException?
The `MutuallyExclusiveConfigurationPropertiesException` is an exception that occurs in Spring when multiple configuration properties are defined that are mutually exclusive. This means that these properties cannot be configured together as they conflict with each other.

Often, developers face this exception when they unintentionally configure properties that have conflicting definitions within the same application context. This exception helps to identify and prevent such configuration errors.

## Scenarios where the exception occurs
To better understand when the `MutuallyExclusiveConfigurationPropertiesException` occurs, let's take a look at a few scenarios:

### Example 1: Conflicting database configurations
Suppose you are configuring two separate database connections in your Spring application using different properties. However, you accidentally configure both connections to use the same database URL or credentials.

```java
@ConfigurationProperties("spring.datasource.primary")
public class PrimaryDataSourceProperties {
    // properties for primary datasource
}

@ConfigurationProperties("spring.datasource.secondary")
public class SecondaryDataSourceProperties {
    // properties for secondary datasource
}
```

In this example, if `spring.datasource.primary.url` and `spring.datasource.secondary.url` mistakenly have the same value, the `MutuallyExclusiveConfigurationPropertiesException` will be thrown.

### Example 2: Conflicting feature toggles
Another scenario where this exception may occur is when defining feature toggles in an application. Let's consider a case where you have two properties for enabling or disabling two different features:

```java
@ConfigurationProperties("app.feature1")
public class Feature1Properties {
    // properties for feature 1
}

@ConfigurationProperties("app.feature2")
public class Feature2Properties {
    // properties for feature 2
}
```

If both `app.feature1.enabled` and `app.feature2.enabled` are set to `true`, the `MutuallyExclusiveConfigurationPropertiesException` will be raised as these features cannot be enabled together.

## How to avoid the exception?
To prevent the `MutuallyExclusiveConfigurationPropertiesException`, you must ensure that mutually exclusive properties do not conflict with each other. Here are a few strategies to help you avoid this exception:

### 1. Configuration review
Perform a thorough review of your configuration properties to identify any conflicts. Carefully analyze the properties that are marked as mutually exclusive and ensure they are correctly configured.

### 2. Property validation
Leverage the power of property validation in Spring Boot. By using validation annotations such as `@AssertFalse` or `@AssertTrue`, you can enforce constraints on the properties to prevent conflicting configurations.

```java
@ConfigurationProperties("app.feature1")
public class Feature1Properties {
    @AssertFalse(message = "app.feature1.enabled and app.feature2.enabled cannot be true together")
    private boolean enabled;
    // other properties
}
```

In this example, if both `app.feature1.enabled` and `app.feature2.enabled` are set to `true`, a validation error will be thrown.

### 3. Conditional configuration
Use conditional configuration to limit the activation of mutually exclusive features. By employing `@ConditionalOnProperty` or `@ConditionalOnExpression`, you can ensure that only one property is active at a time.

```java
@Configuration
public class FeatureConfiguration {

    @Autowired
    private Feature1Properties feature1Properties;

    @Autowired
    private Feature2Properties feature2Properties;

    @Bean
    @ConditionalOnProperty("app.feature1.enabled")
    public Feature1 feature1() {
        return new Feature1(feature1Properties);
    }

    @Bean
    @ConditionalOnProperty("app.feature2.enabled")
    public Feature2 feature2() {
        return new Feature2(feature2Properties);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Feature1` bean will be created only if `app.feature1.enabled` is set to `true`, while the `Feature2` bean will be created only if `app.feature2.enabled` is set to `true`. By doing this, you ensure that conflicting features are not active at the same time.

## Conclusion
The `MutuallyExclusiveConfigurationPropertiesException` is a helpful exception in Spring that aids in identifying and preventing configuration mishaps. By carefully reviewing and validating your configuration properties, you can avoid encountering this exception. Additionally, utilizing conditional configuration allows you to control the activation of mutually exclusive features.

Remember to thoroughly inspect your configuration to ensure that properties are not conflicting and to leverage the power of property validation and conditional configuration when necessary. By following these practices, you can avoid the `MutuallyExclusiveConfigurationPropertiesException` and ensure smooth configuration of your Spring applications.

I hope this article has provided you with a comprehensive understanding of the `MutuallyExclusiveConfigurationPropertiesException` and how to handle it. Happy coding!
