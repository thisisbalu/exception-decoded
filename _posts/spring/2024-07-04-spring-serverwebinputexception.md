## What is ServerWebInputException?

ServerWebInputException is an exception class provided by Spring Framework. It is a subtype of the broader WebInputException class and is primarily used in Spring WebFlux applications. This exception is typically thrown when there are issues with client inputs, such as invalid data or unsupported content types.

When ServerWebInputException occurs, it indicates that an error has occurred during the processing of the incoming request and the request cannot be handled properly without resolving the encountered input issues.


## Causes of ServerWebInputException in Spring

ServerWebInputException can be caused by various factors, including:

1. **Invalid or Malformed Request Payload**: If the structure or format of the request payload does not adhere to the expected schema, ServerWebInputException may be thrown.

2. **Unsupported Content Type**: When the server does not support the content type specified in the request's Content-Type header, ServerWebInputException can occur. This commonly happens when the Content-Type is not correctly set or when attempting to consume unsupported content types.

3. **Missing or Invalid Request Parameters**: If the request parameters are missing or do not match the expected format, ServerWebInputException may be thrown.

4. **Parsing Errors**: When attempting to parse the request input (e.g., JSON, XML), any parsing errors can lead to the creation of a ServerWebInputException.


## How to Handle ServerWebInputException

1. ### Using Exception Handling Mechanisms

Handling ServerWebInputException involves utilizing Spring's exception handling mechanisms. These mechanisms allow you to intercept exceptions and provide custom error responses to the client.

#### Spring Boot Controller Advice

One way to handle ServerWebInputException is by using a `@ControllerAdvice` class in combination with the `@ExceptionHandler` annotation.
  
```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {
  
  @ExceptionHandler(ServerWebInputException.class)
  public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleServerWebInputException(ServerWebInputException ex) {
      ErrorResponse errorResponse = new ErrorResponse("Invalid Request", ex.getMessage());
      return new ResponseEntity<>(errorResponse, HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
  }
  
}
```

By annotating a method within a `@ControllerAdvice` class with `@ExceptionHandler(ServerWebInputException.class)`, we can handle exceptions of type ServerWebInputException and return an appropriate error response to the client. In this example, we generate a custom `ErrorResponse` object and respond with a HTTP 400 Bad Request status.

#### Custom Exception Handling

Alternatively, you can handle ServerWebInputException by implementing a custom exception handling component that extends `ExceptionHandlerExceptionResolver`:

```java
public class CustomExceptionResolver extends ExceptionHandlerExceptionResolver {
  
  @Override
  protected ModelAndView doResolveHandlerMethodException(HttpServletRequest request, 
                                                         HttpServletResponse response,
                                                         HandlerMethod handlerMethod,
                                                         Exception ex) {
    if (ex instanceof ServerWebInputException) {
      ErrorResponse errorResponse = new ErrorResponse("Invalid Request", ex.getMessage());
      response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_BAD_REQUEST);
      return new ModelAndView().addObject("errorResponse", errorResponse);
    }
    return super.doResolveHandlerMethodException(request, response, handlerMethod, ex);
  }

}
```

By overriding the `doResolveHandlerMethodException` method, you can intercept the ServerWebInputException and customize the error response as required.


2. ### Request Body Validation

A common cause of ServerWebInputException is invalid data in the request body. Spring provides various options for request body validation, such as Bean Validation API (JSR-303) annotations and Spring's `@Valid` annotation.

Consider the following example where a Spring WebFlux `@RestController` validates the request payload:

```java
@RestController
public class UserController {
  
  @PostMapping("/users")
  public Mono<User> createUser(@Valid @RequestBody User user) {
    // Business logic to create a user
  }
  
}
```

By annotating the request body parameter with `@Valid`, Spring automatically performs validation using the specified validation annotations, such as `@NotEmpty` or `@Pattern`. If the validation fails, a ServerWebInputException will be thrown and can be handled using the methods discussed earlier.


## Preventing ServerWebInputException

While handling ServerWebInputException is essential, it is even better to prevent them from occurring in the first place. Here are some recommended practices to minimize the occurrence of ServerWebInputException:

1. ### Input Validation

Implement proper input validation mechanisms to validate client inputs before processing them. Consider leveraging validation annotations from the Bean Validation API, such as `@NotBlank`, `@Size`, or custom annotations, to ensure the validity of the incoming data.

```java
public class User {
  
  @NotBlank
  private String username;
  
  @Size(min = 8)
  private String password;
  
  // Getters and Setters
  
}
```

By applying these annotations, Spring validates the user object's fields before processing them, helping to prevent ServerWebInputException from being thrown.


2. ### Error Tolerance

Design your application to be fault-tolerant by incorporating error handling mechanisms, defensive programming techniques, and providing meaningful error responses to the client. This approach helps users understand the cause of the issues and provides instructions for resolving them. Ensuring graceful handling of exceptions reduces the frequency of ServerWebInputException occurrences.

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored ServerWebInputException in Spring and discussed various aspects around handling and preventing it. We learned about the causes of ServerWebInputException and explored two approaches to effectively handle it - using Spring Boot Controller Advice or custom exception handling. Additionally, we discussed the importance of request body validation and implementing input validation practices to prevent ServerWebInputException. By adhering to these best practices, you can create robust and reliable Spring applications.

Remember, properly handling and preventing exceptions like ServerWebInputException goes a long way in delivering a seamless user experience.
