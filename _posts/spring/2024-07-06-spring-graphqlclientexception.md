Introduction
---
GraphQL is a powerful query language for APIs that allows clients to specify exactly the data they need, eliminating over-fetching and under-fetching problems commonly seen in REST APIs. With the rise in popularity of GraphQL, developers have embraced it as an efficient way to retrieve and manipulate data from the server. However, like any technology, GraphQL is not immune to errors. In this article, we will explore how to handle GraphQlClientException in Spring, gracefully dealing with GraphQL errors and ensuring a smooth user experience.

## What is GraphQlClientException?
GraphQlClientException is an exception that can be thrown when a GraphQL operation encounters an error during execution. It is a type of RuntimeException that is specific to GraphQL and is commonly used in Spring GraphQL implementations.

When a GraphQL query or mutation is executed, the server may encounter validation errors, execution errors, or data fetching errors. These errors are encapsulated in the GraphQlClientException object, providing valuable information about the encountered error, such as error messages, error codes, and error locations.

## Common Scenarios for encountering GraphQlClientException
There are several scenarios where a GraphQlClientException may be thrown:

1. **Query Validation Error**: When the query sent to the server does not match the GraphQL schema and fails validation, a GraphQlClientException is thrown. This may occur due to incorrect query syntax or invalid field selection.

2. **Execution Error**: If there is an error during the execution of a query or mutation, such as a permission error or a business rule violation, a GraphQlClientException is thrown. These errors are often caused by the user's action or the server's internal logic.

3. **Data Fetching Error**: GraphQL allows clients to specify the required fields in a single query, and the server is responsible for fetching the data efficiently. If there is an error fetching the required data, such as a network failure or an external service error, a GraphQlClientException is thrown.

## Handling GraphQlClientException in Spring
Now, let's explore different approaches to handle GraphQlClientException gracefully in a Spring application.

### 1. Global Exception Handling with @ControllerAdvice
Using the `@ControllerAdvice` annotation, we can define a global exception handler that will intercept any GraphQlClientException thrown within our application. This approach ensures consistent error handling throughout the application.

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class GraphQlExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(GraphQlClientException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleGraphQlClientException(GraphQlClientException ex) {
        // Extract error information from the exception
        GraphQlError error = ex.getError();

        // Log the error for further analysis
        log.error("GraphQL Error - Message: {}, Code: {}", error.getMessage(), error.getCode());

        // Construct a suitable error response
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
                .body(error.getMessage());
    }
}
```

In the above example, we define a method annotated with `@ExceptionHandler` that handles the `GraphQlClientException` specifically. Within this method, we can extract relevant information from the exception, such as error messages or error codes, and log them for debugging purposes. We then construct an appropriate error response, which can be customized based on the specific requirements of the application.

### 2. Dealing with Field Error
In GraphQL, field errors can occur when a specific field within a query or mutation fails to execute successfully. To handle field errors separately, we can extend the global exception handler from the previous example to handle `GraphQlFieldError` instances.

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class GraphQlExceptionHandler {

    // Global exception handler for GraphQlClientException
    @ExceptionHandler(GraphQlClientException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleGraphQlClientException(GraphQlClientException ex) {
        // Extract error information from the exception
        GraphQlError error = ex.getError();

        if (error instanceof GraphQlFieldError) {
            // Handle field-level errors
            return handleFieldError((GraphQlFieldError) error);
        }

        // Log the error for further analysis
        log.error("GraphQL Error - Message: {}, Code: {}", error.getMessage(), error.getCode());

        // Construct a generic error response
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
                .body(error.getMessage());
    }

    // Method to handle field-level errors
    private ResponseEntity<String> handleFieldError(GraphQlFieldError error) {
        // Extract field-specific error information
        String fieldPath = error.getFieldPath().toString();
        String errorMessage = error.getMessage();

        // Construct an error response with field-specific details
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST)
                .body(String.format("Field Error - Path: %s, Message: %s", fieldPath, errorMessage));
    }
}
```

In this updated example, we added a new method `handleFieldError` to handle `GraphQlFieldError` instances separately. We extract field-specific information, such as the field path and error message, and construct a suitable error response. This allows finer-grained error handling, enabling better context-specific error messages for the clients.

### 3. Custom Error Handling
While the global exception handler approach is suitable for most applications, there may be cases where custom error handling is required. To achieve this, we can implement a custom `GraphQlExceptionHandler` component that extends the `GraphQlExceptionHandlerAdapter` provided by Spring GraphQL.

```java
@Component
public class CustomGraphQlExceptionHandler extends GraphQlExceptionHandlerAdapter {

    @Override
    public GraphQLError handleException(Throwable throwable) {
        // Handle custom exceptions here and return a GraphQLError
        if (throwable instanceof CustomException) {
            CustomException customException = (CustomException) throwable;
            String errorMessage = customException.getMessage();

            return GraphQlErrorBuilder.newError()
                    .message(errorMessage)
                    .build();
        }

        // Fallback to default error handling
        return super.handleException(throwable);
    }
}
```

In the above example, we define a custom `CustomGraphQlExceptionHandler` that extends `GraphQlExceptionHandlerAdapter`. Within the `handleException` method, we can handle custom exceptions as per our application's requirements and return a suitable `GraphQLError` object. This approach gives us full control over the exception handling process, allowing us to provide specific error messages and codes.

## Conclusion
In this article, we learned about the GraphQlClientException in Spring and explored different techniques to handle GraphQL errors with ease. By leveraging global exception handling, dealing with field errors, and implementing custom error handling, we can ensure that our Spring applications gracefully handle GraphQlClientException and provide a seamless user experience.

Handling GraphQlClientException is an essential aspect of building robust and reliable GraphQL-based applications. By understanding the common scenarios for encountering GraphQlClientException and employing the techniques described in this article, developers can effectively handle GraphQL errors and enhance the overall quality of their Spring applications.
