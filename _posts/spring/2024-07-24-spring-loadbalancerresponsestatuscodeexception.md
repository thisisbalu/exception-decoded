**What is LoadBalancerResponseStatusCodeException?**

LoadBalancerResponseStatusCodeException is an exception class provided by Spring Cloud LoadBalancer, which is a part of the Spring Cloud ecosystem. It is thrown when the response status code received from a load-balanced service is not within the range of 200-299. This exception typically occurs when the load-balanced service returns an error response.

The LoadBalancerResponseStatusCodeException extends the RestClientResponseException, allowing developers to handle it efficiently using Spring's powerful exception handling mechanisms.

**How to Handle LoadBalancerResponseStatusCodeException in Spring**

Handling the LoadBalancerResponseStatusCodeException can be done both globally and locally in your Spring application. Let's take a closer look at both approaches.

###### **Handling the Exception Globally**

One way to handle the LoadBalancerResponseStatusCodeException globally is by implementing an error handler using the `@ControllerAdvice` annotation. This allows you to centralize the exception handling logic and apply it to all controllers within your Spring application.

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {
    
    @ExceptionHandler(LoadBalancerResponseStatusCodeException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleLoadBalancerResponseException(LoadBalancerResponseStatusCodeException ex) {
        // Handle the exception and return a custom error response
        ErrorResponse errorResponse = new ErrorResponse(ex.getStatusCode(), ex.getStatusText(), ex.getResponseBodyAsString());
        return new ResponseEntity<>(errorResponse, ex.getStatusCode());
    }
    
    // ... Other exception handlers
    
    // Define an ErrorResponse class for the custom error response
    // (status code, status text, and the actual error message)
    private static class ErrorResponse {
        private int statusCode;
        private String statusText;
        private String errorMessage;
        
        // Constructor, getters, and setters
    }
}
```

In the above code snippet, we define a `GlobalExceptionHandler` class annotated with `@ControllerAdvice`. Inside this class, we have a method annotated with `@ExceptionHandler` specifically for handling the LoadBalancerResponseStatusCodeException. The method takes the exception as a parameter and returns a custom error response.

By returning a `ResponseEntity` object, we can customize the response body, status code, and headers to suit our needs. In this example, we create a custom `ErrorResponse` class to encapsulate the necessary information including the status code, status text, and the actual error message. This way, we have full control over the error response structure.

###### **Handling the Exception Locally**

Another approach is to handle the LoadBalancerResponseStatusCodeException locally within a specific controller or service. This provides more fine-grained control over the exception handling logic.

```java
@RestController
public class MyController {
    
    @Autowired
    private LoadBalancerClient loadBalancerClient;
    
    @GetMapping("/example")
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleLoadBalancerResponseException() {
        try {
            // Make a load-balanced request using the LoadBalancerClient
            ResponseEntity<String> response = loadBalancerClient.execute("serviceId", request -> {
                // Set the request headers and body if required
                // ...
                
                // Execute the request and return the response
                return request.execute();
            });
            
            // Check the response status code
            if (response.getStatusCode().is2xxSuccessful()) {
                // Process the successful response
                return ResponseEntity.ok(response.getBody());
            } else {
                // Handle the error response
                throw new LoadBalancerResponseStatusCodeException(response.getStatusCode(), response.getStatusText(), response.getBody(), null);
            }
        } catch (LoadBalancerResponseStatusCodeException ex) {
            // Handle the exception locally and return an appropriate response
            return ResponseEntity.status(ex.getStatusCode()).body(ex.getResponseBodyAsString());
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a `MyController` class annotated with `@RestController`. Inside the controller, we autowire the `LoadBalancerClient` to interact with the load-balanced service.

Within the `handleLoadBalancerResponseException` method, we use the `LoadBalancerClient` to make a load-balanced request. We then check the response status code using the `getStatusCode()` method. If it falls within the successful range (2xx), we process the response as needed. However, if the response status code indicates an error, we manually throw the `LoadBalancerResponseStatusCodeException` with the relevant information.

To handle the exception, we use a try-catch block and catch the `LoadBalancerResponseStatusCodeException`. Here, we can handle the exception locally by returning an appropriate response using the `ResponseEntity` object.

**Conclusion**

In this article, we have explored the LoadBalancerResponseStatusCodeException in Spring and discussed how to handle it effectively using both global and local approaches. By implementing proper exception handling, you can provide meaningful error responses and improve the overall resilience of your Spring applications.

Remember, understanding and addressing exceptions, such as the LoadBalancerResponseStatusCodeException, is crucial for reliable and robust application development. By following the techniques presented in this article, you can elevate your error handling capabilities in Spring.

We hope this article has been helpful in demystifying the LoadBalancerResponseStatusCodeException and providing you with valuable insights on how to handle it gracefully in your Spring applications.

Happy coding!
