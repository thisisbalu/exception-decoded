Spring is a very flexible and powerful framework which powers many of the modern Java applications. It provides a great level of ease and control to the developers for creating enterprise-grade applications. But along with such power and features, comes a greater responsibility and that is to keep track of potential issues that might crop up during the development process. One such issue that we're going to discuss today revolves around IdInterfaceException in Spring framework. 

### Overview of IdInterfaceException 

Before we get into the specifics of IdInterfaceException, let's first understand what it is. This exception is generally thrown by the Spring framework when a particular bean doesn't adhere to the necessary rules or guidelines deemed by the framework. This might be due to the bean not following a particular interface, hence giving rise to the exception.

So, let's take a closer look at this exception and identify how we can handle it effectively for smoother Spring-powered application development.


## Understanding IdInterfaceException

IdInterfaceException is often thrown when you are trying to map an interface as a persistent entity. Spring Data expects all the mapped entities to be classes, but if it encounters an interface, it throws this error. Let's take a look at a simple code block.

```java
public interface User {
    
}
```

```java
@Repository
public interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository<User, Long> {
    
}
```
If you run this application, you'll get IdInterfaceException. Spring Data JPA/Hibernate expects the entity to be a class, but here they have an interface. 

## Handling IdInterfaceException

```java
@Entity
public class User {
    
}
```

```java
@Repository
public interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository<User, Long> {
    
}
```

Now, if you run this, all should be well. 

## Common Scenario causing IdInterfaceException

A common scenario causing IdInterfaceException is a breach of the rules regarding amount and types of identifiers a bean/entity can have for a database. For instance, if you're mapping a bean to a database table, each particular bean must have an identifier (like @Id) which uniquely identifies a particular row or data entry.

```java
@Entity
public class User {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;
}
```

If the bean lacks such an identifier, it gives rise to IdInterfaceException, as it's against the Spring JPA or ORM guidelines.

## Prevention

While IdInterfaceException can occur due to various reasons, it is vital to remember that prevention is always better than cure. Ensuring proper usage of classes vs interfaces in Spring Data repositories, following JPA/ORM guidelines while mapping beans to database tables, and rigorously testing your codebase to catch potential issues/bottlenecks should help in curbing these type of issues.

## Conclusion

We have not only discussed the concept of IdInterfaceException in depth but also showcased scenarios where it commonly occurs. This should give you a fair idea about it and the know-how to tackle it in a real-world scenario. Happy Coding!

Keep in mind, Spring is a very versatile and expansive Java framework. It offers a plethora of exceptions for specific scenarios, and understanding each one of them can take a significant amount of time. However, with a little patience and fair amount of practice, you can surely master Spring and its vast list of exceptions.
