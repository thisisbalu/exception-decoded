As developers delve into the intricacies of the Spring Framework, they can encounter an array of exceptions that may seem daunting at first. One of these is the `NonSkippableReadException`. This article will dissect the `NonSkippableReadException`, helping you to understand what it is, why it occurs, and how to effectively handle it within your Spring applications.

## What is NonSkippableReadException?

The `NonSkippableReadException` is part of the Spring Batch framework and specifically arises during the step execution of batch processing. This exception is thrown when a read operation cannot be skipped. This occurs primarily when the framework encounters an issue while reading data that cannot be resolved or retried, making the read operation critical for the flow.

### Where It Originates

You may typically meet this exception when dealing with `ItemReader` implementations. Let's clarify this with a simple example:

```java
public class CustomItemReader implements ItemReader<MyData> {
    @Override
    public MyData read() throws Exception {
        // Imagine reading from a database or a file
        // Some logic that reads data
        if (dataNotFound) {
            throw new NonSkippableReadException("Data not found for processing");
        }
        return myData;
    }
}
```

In this case, if the data input is missing or invalid, the `NonSkippableReadException` would be triggered.

## Why You Encounter NonSkippableReadException

The key reasons for encountering the `NonSkippableReadException` include:

1. **Incomplete Data**: If your job requires specific data that is not present in your source, the read operation fails.
2. **Configuration Issues**: Improper job or step configurations might lead to unexpected behavior during data reading.
3. **Database Constraints**: Reading from a database where unique or foreign key constraints are violated can also lead to this exception.

## Handling NonSkippableReadException

When you face the `NonSkippableReadException`, understanding how to manage it becomes crucial. Here are a few strategies you can employ:

### Step 1: Adjusting Configuration

One straightforward approach is to ensure that your reader is correctly set up. Ensure that it uses appropriate query parameters or file paths to avoid missing crucial data.

### Step 2: Implementing Skip Logic

In some cases, you might want to allow the system to skip errors, but with `NonSkippableReadException`, this might not be feasible. Therefore, be prepared to handle the exception gracefully:

```java
@Bean
public Step sampleStep() {
    return stepBuilderFactory.get("sampleStep")
        .<MyData, ProcessedData>chunk(10)
        .reader(customItemReader())
        .processor(customItemProcessor())
        .writer(customItemWriter())
        .faultTolerant()
        .skip(NonSkippableReadException.class) // This won't help here; use with other exceptions
        .skipLimit(5)
        .build();
}
```

### Step 3: Customizing the Reader

If you're certain that your implementation might run into inconsistent data, you could enhance your reader's logic to handle exceptions in a more predictable manner:

```java
public class RobustItemReader implements ItemReader<MyData> {
    @Override
    public MyData read() throws Exception {
        try {
            // Logic for reading data
        } catch (DataNotFoundException ex) {
            // Log error and return null or handle it as needed
            log.error("Data not found, skipping read: " + ex.getMessage());
            return null;
        }
    }
}
```

Using this method, you can allow your job to handle gaps in data by returning `null` or some placeholder.

### Step 4: Monitoring and Logging

Implement effective monitoring and logging mechanisms. This is crucial for diagnosing issues promptly. Hereâ€™s an example of setting a logger:

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class CustomItemReader implements ItemReader<MyData> {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(CustomItemReader.class);

    @Override
    public MyData read() throws Exception {
        if (dataIssue) {
            logger.error("NonSkippableReadException occurred while trying to read data.");
            throw new NonSkippableReadException("Critical read error!");
        }
        return myData;
    }
}
```

This will allow you to keep track of when and why your `NonSkippableReadException` arose in your application.

## Conclusion

The `NonSkippableReadException` serves as a reminder of the intricacies of batch processing in Spring. Understanding its root causes and implementing effective handling techniques is critical for ensuring robust applications. 

In essence, aim to prepare your application to deal with incomplete or corrupted data sources proactively. Use the strategies discussed above to enhance your application's resilience and maintainability.
