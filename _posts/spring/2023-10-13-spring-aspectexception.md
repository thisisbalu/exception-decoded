Spring is an open-source Java-based framework, extensively used worldwide because of its well-defined structure and flexibility. One feature of Spring that distinguishes it from other frameworks is its Aspect-oriented Programming (AOP) mechanism. Although powerful, working with AOP may give rise to a common stumbling block among developersâ€”the notorious AspectException. This article will take a deep dive into AspectException, its causes, and how to handle it in your Spring projects. 

## What is AspectException?

The AspectException is a form of RuntimeException that typically surfaces when something goes wrong in the aspect-oriented programming paradigm of the Spring framework. The potential issues can range from failing to create the AOP proxy to not being able to bind aspects. 

## A Close Look at AspectException

Like any other Java exception, you encounter AspectException typically wrapped in a root cause. By unwrapping this root cause, you can get valuable insight into the nature of the problem. The general form of AspectException looks like this:

```java
org.springframework.aop.aspectj.AspectJAdviceParameterNotDeclaredException: Named pointcut expression expected to match 0 parameters, but has been invoked with  1
```

## The Core Issue 

A common instance of triggering AspectException is by declaring an advice method, but failing to match the expected parameters. For example, you declare a method as follows:

```java
@AfterReturning(pointcut  = "execution(* com.yourpackage.YourService+.*(..))",returning = "returnValue")
public void afterMethodCall(Object returnValue){
    
}
```

The above method will cause an AspectException if the pointcut matches a public `void` method. The reason is simple: A void method does not return anything, while the advice method expects a non-null return value.

## Handling AspectException 

Now that we understand the common cause lets look at how to handle this exception. Fixing an AspectException often involves handling the root cause, as AspectException is generally a wrapper for other exceptions.

To avoid runtime surprises wrapped in AspectException, it's a good practice to enable compile-time weaving. Incorporate the AspectJ's aspectj-maven-plugin in your Maven project as follows:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspectj-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>1.12.6</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>compile</goal>
                <goal>test-compile</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

This will weave your aspects at compile-time, providing feedback instantly on any misconfigurations and thus, avoiding unpleasant surprises at runtime.

## Conclusion

Mastering the AspectException eccentricity in Spring framework requires an understanding of Aspect-oriented Programming mechanism and its potential pitfalls. If you approach the issue with clarity, it is an easy one to rectify. Enabling compile-time weaving will catch the issues early in the development and makes applications less likely to encounter AspectException at runtime. 

Handling the AspectException well will allow you to fully maximize the potential of Spring's AOP, making your application more flexible, modular and maintainable.
