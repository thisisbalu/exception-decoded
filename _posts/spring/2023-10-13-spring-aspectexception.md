Ever found yourself in a bind, trying to wrestle with the many nuances of `AspectException` in Spring Framework? You've certainly come to the right place. In this informative tutorial, we're going to delve deep into the world of `AspectException` to get an insightful understanding of this concept in the context of Spring framework. Don't fret! We've got a plethora of code examples lined up, just for you.

## What is AspectException?

Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) finds its prime application in the Spring Framework. An integral part of this framework, `AspectException`, can sometimes become a headache if not comprehended well. Let's try to decode this mystery in the simplest terms. `AspectException` is a subtype of a `FatalBeanException`, a robust exception generated when an error occurs during normal operations of the application or we can say, when an exception is thrown in an aspect[^1^].

```java
public class AspectException extends org.springframework.beans.FatalBeanException {
    ...
}
```

## Common Causes for AspectException

Apart from the general fact stated above, the exceptions can have different causes based on the specific subclass of AspectException. Let's look at two major subclasses:

1. `AspectConfigurationException`: Generated when an error occurs in the AspectJ configuration. This might occur within an attempt to configure an aspect through pointcut expressions or other related elements.
2. `NotAnAtAspectException`: Generated when an attempt is made to treat a class as an aspect (using the `@Aspect` annotation) whereas it isn't.

## How to Mitigate AspectException

Skilfully avoiding `AspectException` isnâ€™t sorcery; it's more about understanding and working smoothly around aspects.

### For AspectConfigurationException

Ensure the configuration of the aspect components is done correctly. Any syntax mistakes in your pointcut expressions can lead to this exception. Let's illustrate with an example:

```java
@Aspect
public class LoggingAspect {

    @Pointcut("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
    public void loggingPointcut() {
        ...
    }
}
```

Here, the pointcut is correctly defined to include all methods (`*.*`) of any class in package `com.example.service` with any arguments (`(..)`). Any syntax mistakes can lead to `AspectConfigurationException`.

### For NotAnAtAspectException

If a class is being treated as an aspect and it's not, double-check if the `@Aspect` annotation is placed correctly and isn't present where it's not supposed to be. See this problematic scenario:

```java
@Service 
@Aspect 
public class LoggingService {
    ...
}
```
The class LoggingService has been wrongly annotated as an aspect using `@Aspect`. Remember, it's crucial to keep your service and aspect concerns separate.

## Catching AspectException

In some scenarios, you might want to catch `AspectException`. Optimally, you need to place a try-catch block around the method where you expect it to occur. 

```java
try {
    ...
} catch(AspectException ex) {
    LOGGER.error("AspectException occured", ex);
    // handle here
}
```

## Conclusion

With this tutorial, our aim has been to make you as well equipped with `AspectException` as a seasoned Spring Framework developer. The road to mastering this exception is no more mystifying, right? Keep exploring, keep coding, and keep Spring-ing!
