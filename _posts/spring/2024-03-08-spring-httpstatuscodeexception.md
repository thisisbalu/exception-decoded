## Introduction

In any web application, dealing with HTTP status codes is a common requirement. Spring Framework provides a robust mechanism for handling exceptions that occur during the processing of HTTP requests. One such exception, HttpStatusCodeException, plays a vital role in handling and interacting with the responses containing specific HTTP status codes. In this article, we will delve into the details of HttpStatusCodeException and explore how to leverage its features effectively in your Spring applications.

## What is HttpStatusCodeException?

HttpStatusCodeException is a subclass of the RuntimeException, specifically designed to handle HTTP exceptions that occur during HTTP operations in a Spring application. This exception provides a convenient way to extract and interpret response details from a failed HTTP request. By extending this exception, we gain access to the HTTP status code, response headers, and the response body, enabling us to handle and analyze errors more effectively.

## How Does HttpStatusCodeException Work?

When an HTTP request fails with an error status code, Spring throws an instance of HttpStatusCodeException. This exception can be caught and processed within our application's context, allowing us to implement custom error handling logic.

Here's a simple example to demonstrate this process. Let's consider an application that makes an HTTP GET request to a remote API and expects a JSON response. If the response status code is not in the 2xx range (indicating a success), a HttpStatusCodeException will be thrown.

```java
import org.springframework.http.*;
import org.springframework.web.client.*;

public class CustomApiClient {
    
    private final RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
    private final String apiEndpointUrl = "https://api.example.com/data";
    
    public void fetchDataFromAPI() {
        try {
            ResponseEntity<String> response = restTemplate.exchange(
                apiEndpointUrl, HttpMethod.GET, null, String.class);
            // Process the successful response
        } catch (HttpStatusCodeException e) {
            handleException(e);
        }
    }
    
    private void handleException(HttpStatusCodeException e) {
        int statusCode = e.getStatusCode().value();
        HttpHeaders headers = e.getResponseHeaders();
        String responseBody = e.getResponseBodyAsString();
        
        // Custom error handling logic based on statusCode, headers, and responseBody
    }
}
```

In the above example, we use the `RestTemplate` class provided by Spring to make the HTTP request. If an error occurs, the catch block catches the `HttpStatusCodeException` and forwards it to the `handleException` method. This method then retrieves useful information from the exception, such as the status code, headers, and response body, which can be utilized for further processing.

## Useful Methods in HttpStatusCodeException

HttpStatusCodeException provides several useful methods to extract information from the exception. Let's explore some of the commonly used ones:

- `getStatusCode()` - This method returns the actual HttpStatus object representing the HTTP status code.
- `getStatusCodeValue()` - This method returns the integer value of the HTTP status code.
- `getResponseHeaders()` - This method retrieves the response headers as an instance of HttpHeaders.
- `getResponseBodyAsString()` - This method retrieves the response body as a String.

## Handling Different HTTP Status Codes

HttpStatusCodesExceptions are particularly helpful when dealing with specific HTTP error codes. With their aid, we can define custom behavior for different error scenarios. Let's take a look at a few examples:

### Handling 404 Not Found

```java
import org.springframework.http.*;
import org.springframework.web.client.*;

public class CustomApiClient {
    
    // ...
    
    public void fetchDataFromAPI() {
        try {
            // ...
        } catch (HttpClientErrorException.NotFound e) {
            handleNotFoundException(e);
        } catch (HttpStatusCodeException e) {
            handleException(e);
        }
    }
    
    private void handleNotFoundException(HttpClientErrorException.NotFound e) {
        int statusCode = e.getStatusCode().value();
        HttpHeaders headers = e.getResponseHeaders();
        String responseBody = e.getResponseBodyAsString();
        
        // Custom error handling logic specific to 404 Not Found
    }
}
```

In this example, we catch the `HttpClientErrorException.NotFound` exception, which is a subclass of HttpStatusCodeException specifically for a 404 Not Found response. This allows us to apply custom error handling logic specific to this particular error scenario.

### Handling 401 Unauthorized

```java
import org.springframework.http.*;
import org.springframework.web.client.*;

public class CustomApiClient {
    
    // ...
    
    public void fetchDataFromAPI() {
        try {
            // ...
        } catch (HttpClientErrorException.Unauthorized e) {
            handleUnauthorizedException(e);
        } catch (HttpStatusCodeException e) {
            handleException(e);
        }
    }
    
    private void handleUnauthorizedException(HttpClientErrorException.Unauthorized e) {
        int statusCode = e.getStatusCode().value();
        HttpHeaders headers = e.getResponseHeaders();
        String responseBody = e.getResponseBodyAsString();
        
        // Custom error handling logic specific to 401 Unauthorized
    }
}
```

Similar to the previous example, we can catch the `HttpClientErrorException.Unauthorized` exception, which represents a 401 Unauthorized response. This allows us to define specialized error handling behavior for this particular error status code.

## Conclusion

Exception handling is a crucial aspect of any application's error management strategy. With the HttpStatusCodeException class in Spring, we have a powerful tool to handle HTTP exceptions efficiently. By leveraging the methods provided by this class, we can extract relevant information from the exception object and implement custom logic tailored to specific HTTP error scenarios.

In this article, we explored the basics of HttpStatusCodeException, its usage within Spring applications, and how to handle different HTTP status codes. Incorporating this knowledge into your Spring projects will help you build robust and reliable web applications with comprehensive error handling capabilities.
