Welcome to yet another enlightening edition on Spring Framework's technicalities. Today, we will dissect and elaborate on a crucial element of Spring's existing features – the `BackOffInterruptedException`. Our aim here is to not just understand its functionalities but also unmask various troubleshooting strategies for it. This comprehension would enrich your understanding and experience of working with the Spring Framework. 

## Deep-dive into the BackOffInterruptedException

Understanding `BackOffInterruptedException` deeply is a prerequisite to utilize it efficiently. So, let's jump straight into it!

`BackOffInterruptedException` is a Spring-specific exception that is thrown in situations when a `BackOffPolicy` in Spring's retry mechanism experiences an interruption. This essentially occurs through sleep-based 'back off' policies namely `FixedBackOffPolicy` and `ExponentialBackOffPolicy`.

```java
public class BackOffInterruptedException extends Exception {
    public BackOffInterruptedException(String msg, InterruptedException cause) {
        super(msg, cause);
    }
}
```

## Unmasking BackOffPolicy

In the context of distributed and concurrent processing, 'backoff' refers to the act of delaying an operation or a process temporarily. It is a strategic move ensuring a significant reduction in contention when numerous concurrent processes are within the same stream. Spring’s sophisticated 'retry mechanism' includes `BackOffPolicy` as its prominent part. 

We have two major implementations of `BackOffPolicy`, i.e., `FixedBackOffPolicy` and `ExponentialBackOffPolicy`. In the `FixedBackOffPolicy`, every retry delay is fixed, while in the `ExponentialBackOffPolicy`, the delay duration increases exponentially after each retry.

```java
public interface BackOffPolicy {
    BackOffContext start(RetryContext context);
    void backOff(BackOffContext backOffContext) throws BackOffInterruptedException;
}
```

## The Trigger: Why and When is BackOffInterruptedException thrown?

The `BackOffInterruptedException` is thrown when the `backOff()` method of the `BackOffPolicy` gets interrupted. As this method incorporates a sleep command, any intrusion during the sleeping phase results in an `InterruptedException`, wrapped into a `BackOffInterruptedException`.

```java
public void backOff(BackOffContext backOffContext) throws BackOffInterruptedException {
    try {
        // Some processing...
        TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.sleep(someDuration);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        throw new BackOffInterruptedException("Thread sleep has been interrupted", e);
    }
}
```

## Catching and Handling BackOffInterruptedException

To catch and handle a `BackOffInterruptedException`, you would resort to traditional try-catch blocks. A well-formed error handling measure can shield the program continuity from falling apart.

```java
try {
    // Code invoking BackOffPolicy's backOff method
} catch (BackOffInterruptedException e) {
    // Handling logic
    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
}
```

Remember, Interruptions are an essential part of concurrent programming in Java, and they shouldn't be dismissed silently. When an `InterruptedException` is caught, it's a good practice to either rethrow this exception or restore the interrupted status by calling `Thread.currentThread().interrupt()`.

## Conclusion 

The journey of understanding the depth of `BackOffInterruptedException` in Spring has been quite enriching. By revealing its internals, you should be more competent in managing this exception and enhance the quality of your Spring applications, especially those employing retry logic with sleep-based BackOffPolicies. 

Delving deeper into Spring Framework's exception handling could further blossom this knowledge. The sea of learning is vast, and there are many more such concepts to unravel. If you have any questions or need more details, the [official Spring documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-batch/docs/current/reference/html/index-single.html#backoff) stands as a reliable companion on this voyage.
