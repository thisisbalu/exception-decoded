**Introduction**

In any Spring-based application that deals with authentication and authorization, the occurrence of exceptions is not uncommon. One such exception is the `AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException`. This error occurs when a user attempts to access a protected resource without providing valid credentials. In this article, we will dive deep into understanding this exception and explore ways to handle it effectively.

## 1. What is `AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException`?

`AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException` is an exception that belongs to the Spring Security framework. It is thrown when a user attempts to access a secure resource without providing valid credentials. This exception is a subclass of `AuthenticationException` and is mainly used to handle missing or invalid authentication credentials.


## 2. Why does it occur?

The primary reason behind the occurrence of `AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException` is that the user trying to access a protected resource has not logged in or has not provided any authentication credentials.

In typical scenarios, Spring Security intercepts requests to verify if the user is authenticated or authorized to access a particular resource. If the user is not authenticated and tries to access a secure endpoint, this exception is thrown.


## 3. Handling `AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException`

To handle this exception gracefully, you can utilize Spring Security's features and customize the behavior according to your application's requirements.

Let's take a look at an example to understand the handling of `AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException`:

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler extends ResponseEntityExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<Object> handleAuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException(
            AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException ex, WebRequest request) {
        String errorMessage = "Authentication credentials not found. Please log in to access this resource.";
        ErrorDetails errorDetails = new ErrorDetails(new Date(), errorMessage, request.getDescription(false));
        return new ResponseEntity<>(errorDetails, HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED);
    }
}
```

In this example, we are using `@ControllerAdvice` to define a global exception handler, extending `ResponseEntityExceptionHandler`. By handling `AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException` specifically, we can return a customized error response with the appropriate HTTP status code (in this case, UNAUTHORIZED) and detailed error information. This helps users understand that they need to log in to access the resource.


## 4. Best practices for preventing `AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException`

While handling the exception is essential, it is always a good practice to prevent the occurrence of `AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException` by implementing well-defined authentication mechanisms and following security best practices. Here are a few tips to consider:

### 4.1 Use form-based authentication

Form-based authentication is a widely used authentication mechanism in Spring Security. Utilizing it ensures that users must provide valid credentials before accessing protected resources.

### 4.2 Properly configure access control

Setting up proper access control rules is crucial to prevent unauthorized access. Configure your application to allow access to resources only for authenticated users with the necessary roles and privileges.

### 4.3 Implement remember-me functionality

Implementing the remember-me functionality can enhance the user experience by allowing them to stay logged in even after session expiration. This reduces the chances of encountering `AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException`.

### 4.4 Regularly update Spring Security

Keeping your Spring Security version up to date ensures that you benefit from the latest security patches and fixes. This reduces the risk of potential vulnerabilities that could lead to authentication-related exceptions.

## Conclusion

In this article, we discussed the `AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException` exception in Spring Security. We learned why it occurs, how to handle it gracefully, and discussed best practices to prevent it from happening. Understanding and effectively handling this exception is crucial to provide a secure and seamless user experience in your Spring-based applications.

By following the practices mentioned above and customizing the exception handling, you can ensure that users are informed about missing or invalid authentication credentials, helping maintain the integrity and security of your application.
