## Introduction

Have you ever encountered errors while writing data using Spring? If you have, you are not alone! In this article, we are going to explore the OnWriteError interface in Spring, which provides a powerful mechanism to handle errors that occur during the writing process. Whether you are a Spring beginner or an experienced developer, this comprehensive guide will help you understand the ins and outs of OnWriteError and how to make the most of this feature. So, let's dive in!

## What is OnWriteError?

In Spring Batch, the OnWriteError functionality allows you to define how to handle errors during the writing phase of a batch job. This interface provides a method that is invoked when an error occurs while writing data items. By implementing this interface, you gain control over how to handle such errors, providing the flexibility to retry or skip failed items, or even take custom actions based on your specific application needs.

## The OnWriteError Interface

The OnWriteError interface is part of Spring Batch's infrastructure and can be implemented to cater to your specific requirements. Let's take a closer look at the interface and its methods:

```java
public interface OnWriteError<T> {
    void onWriteError(Exception exception, List<? extends T> items);
}
```

As you can see, the OnWriteError interface expects the implementation to provide the `onWriteError` method. This method is called whenever an error occurs during the writing phase of a batch job. It takes two arguments: the exception that occurred and a list of items that caused the error. With this information, you can handle the error according to your implementation logic.

## Writing a Custom OnWriteError Handler

Now that we have a basic understanding of the OnWriteError interface, let's explore how to implement a custom error handling mechanism using this interface.

```java
public class CustomOnWriteErrorHandler<T> implements OnWriteError<T> {

    public void onWriteError(Exception exception, List<? extends T> items) {
        // Custom error handling logic goes here
    }
}
```

In the code snippet above, we create a custom `CustomOnWriteErrorHandler` class that implements the OnWriteError interface. Within the `onWriteError` method, you can define your own error handling logic based on the exception and list of items provided.

## Configuring OnWriteError in Spring Batch

To enable your custom OnWriteError handler, you need to configure it within the Spring Batch job infrastructure. Let's see how you can do that:

```java
@Bean
public ItemWriter<Object> itemWriter() {
    ItemWriter<Object> itemWriter = new YourItemWriter();
    itemWriter.setWriteSkip(true);
    itemWriter.setSkipLimit(10);

    CustomOnWriteErrorHandler<Object> errorHandler = new CustomOnWriteErrorHandler<>();
    
    // Pass the error handler to the writer
    ((AbstractItemWriter<Object>) itemWriter).setExceptionHandler(errorHandler);

    return itemWriter;
}
```

In the above code snippet, we create an `itemWriter` bean, which is an instance of a custom `YourItemWriter` class that implements the `ItemWriter` interface. We set `writeSkip` to `true`, indicating that we want to skip failed items during the writing process. We also set a skip limit of 10, which means that if the number of errors exceeds this limit, the job will fail. Next, we create an instance of our custom error handler `CustomOnWriteErrorHandler` and pass it to the `itemWriter` using the `setExceptionHandler` method. This enables the error handler to handle any writing errors encountered during the batch job execution.

## Practical Example: Retry and Skip Failed Items

To better understand the usage of OnWriteError, let's consider a practical example where we want to retry failed items a certain number of times before skipping them. We'll use the Spring Retry library to achieve this.

First, let's create a custom `RetryOnWriteError` class that extends the `CustomOnWriteErrorHandler` and provides the retry logic:

```java
import org.springframework.retry.RetryCallback;
import org.springframework.retry.RetryContext;
import org.springframework.retry.RetryPolicy;
import org.springframework.retry.support.RetryTemplate;

public class RetryOnWriteError<T> extends CustomOnWriteErrorHandler<T> {

    private RetryTemplate retryTemplate;
    private RetryPolicy retryPolicy;
    private int maxRetryAttempts;

    public void setRetryTemplate(RetryTemplate retryTemplate) {
        this.retryTemplate = retryTemplate;
    }

    public void setRetryPolicy(RetryPolicy retryPolicy) {
        this.retryPolicy = retryPolicy;
    }

    public void setMaxRetryAttempts(int maxRetryAttempts) {
        this.maxRetryAttempts = maxRetryAttempts;
    }

    @Override
    public void onWriteError(Exception exception, List<? extends T> items) {
        try {
            retryTemplate.execute(new RetryCallback<Void, RuntimeException>() {
                @Override
                public Void doWithRetry(RetryContext retryContext) {
                    // Custom retry logic
                    // Implement the retry mechanism here
                    return null;
                }
            }, retryPolicy);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            super.onWriteError(e, items);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we extend our custom error handler `CustomOnWriteErrorHandler` and override the `onWriteError` method to include the retry logic. By leveraging Spring Retry's `RetryTemplate`, we can easily implement retry logic to handle the error condition. You can customize the number of retry attempts by setting the `maxRetryAttempts` property and provide a `RetryPolicy` to control when to retry or give up.

Now, let's configure the `RetryOnWriteError` class within our Spring Batch job:

```java
@Bean
public ItemWriter<Object> itemWriter() {
    // ...
    RetryOnWriteError<Object> retryHandler = new RetryOnWriteError<>();
    RetryTemplate retryTemplate = new RetryTemplate();
    SimpleRetryPolicy retryPolicy = new SimpleRetryPolicy();
    retryPolicy.setMaxAttempts(3); // Customize the number of retry attempts
    retryHandler.setRetryTemplate(retryTemplate);
    retryHandler.setRetryPolicy(retryPolicy);

    ((AbstractItemWriter<Object>) itemWriter).setExceptionHandler(retryHandler);
    // ...
}
```

In this code snippet, we wire up the `RetryOnWriteError` class by creating an instance of `RetryTemplate` and `SimpleRetryPolicy`. We set the maximum number of retry attempts to 3. Finally, we pass the `retryHandler` to the `itemWriter` using the `setExceptionHandler` method, enabling retry logic for failed items.

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored the OnWriteError interface in Spring Batch and learned how to leverage it to handle errors during the writing phase of a batch job. By implementing the OnWriteError interface, you can define your own custom error handling logic and control how to handle errors when they occur. We also saw a practical example of how to combine OnWriteError with Spring Retry to retry failed items before skipping them. Armed with this knowledge, you can now confidently handle writing errors in your Spring applications.

Remember, error handling is a critical aspect of any application, and understanding how to properly handle errors can greatly improve the reliability and resilience of your systems. So go ahead and implement your own error handling strategy using OnWriteError in Spring!
