Spring Framework has high popularity among developers due to its sophisticated features, flexibility, and ease of use. But as in every tool or framework, sometimes we experience setbacks in the form of exceptions during the development or deployment phase. One such exception is `NonTransientDataAccessResourceException`. So, in this article, we will explore and understand the `NonTransientDataAccessResourceException`. We will look at its causes, effects and methods to handle this exception in Spring Framework.


`NonTransientDataAccessResourceException` is a type of exception that the Spring Framework throws. This subclass of `DataAccessException` signals a problem regarding the underlying resources that an application accesses. The exception is non-transient, meaning it isn't likely to resolve upon retrying.

```java
catch(NonTransientDataAccessResourceException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

It's crucial to note that this exception differs from `TransientDataAccessResourceException`. Unlike `NonTransientDataAccessResourceException`, the latter is resolvable by retrying the failed operation.


`NonTransientDataAccessResourceException` arises when there's a serious issue with the application's underlying resources. Examples include:

- A disallowed SQL operation such as attempting to drop a table.
- An error accessing a database such as incorrect SQL syntax.
- When performing an operation on a resource that doesn't exist.

Also, understand that this exception is thrown because of a serious problem that won't correct itself without intervention.


Dealing with `NonTransientDataAccessResourceException` involves several prevention and handling strategies. Here are a few examples.

## 1. Proficient SQL Query Grammar

We can avoid `NonTransientDataAccessResourceException` by mastering how to query databases. Here's an example of an SQL query that may throw `NonTransientDataAccessResourceException`.

```java
String bogusSql = "SELECT * FRM student";
jdbcTemplate.queryForObject(bogusSql, Student.class);
```

The SQL code, `SELECT * FRM student`, is incorrect â€“ the correct syntax is `SELECT * FROM student`. Using the incorrect code will throw `NonTransientDataAccessResourceException`.

## 2. Check Existence of Resources

Check if the database and/or table exist before performing operations.

```java
String checkTableExistenceSql = 
"SELECT count(*) FROM information_schema.TABLES WHERE (TABLE_SCHEMA = 'yourSchema') AND (TABLE_NAME = 'yourTable')";

int count = jdbcTemplate.queryForObject(checkTableExistenceSql, Integer.class);
if(count==1) {
    String sqlQuery = "SELECT * FROM yourTable";
    jdbcTemplate.queryForObject(sqlQuery, YourClass.class);
} 
```

## 3. Exception Handling

We redo our operation-logic to anticipate and handle the possibility of failure with appropriate error messages.

```java
try {
    String sqlQuery = "SELECT * FROM yourTable";
    jdbcTemplate.queryForObject(sqlQuery, YourClass.class);
} catch (NonTransientDataAccessResourceException e) {
    System.out.println("NonTransientDataAccessResourceException occured: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

In the example above, the catch block will capture and handle the `NonTransientDataAccessResourceException`.


While `NonTransientDataAccessResourceException` presents a significant problem, understanding the causes helps us to take active steps to prevent its occurrence. Use these strategies to prevent this daunting exception from surfacing in your Spring applications.


1. [Spring Framework API Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/dao/NonTransientDataAccessResourceException.html)
2. [Difference between Transient and NonTransient Exceptions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66341180/difference-between-transient-and-nontransient-exceptions-in-spring)

Please note that when handling these exceptions, it's essential to not only print the stack trace but to implement robust logging strategies and alert mechanisms.

Let's avoid `NonTransientDataAccessResourceException`s together. Happy coding!
