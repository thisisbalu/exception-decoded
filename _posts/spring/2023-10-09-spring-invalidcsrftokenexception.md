With the surge in web application development, the need for web security is more vital now than ever. This is where CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) token comes into play. Intriguingly, developers often encounter an `InvalidCsrfTokenException` in the widely used Spring Framework. In this blog, we will plunge deep into `InvalidCsrfTokenException`, understanding what it is, why it occurs, and how to avoid this common pitfall. Think of it as your ultimate guide to mastering this exception in Spring Framework. 

**Before We Begin**

To understand `InvalidCsrfTokenException`, it's vital to have a basic understanding of how Spring Security and CSRF tokens function. If you are already familiar with these concepts, feel free to jump ahead. 

[Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security) is a framework that provides comprehensive security services for Java EE-based enterprise software applications. One such feature is CSRF protection. A CSRF token is a unique value associated with a user's session, this token makes it impossible for an attacker to forge requests on a user's behalf[@csrfprotection]. 

**What is the InvalidCsrfTokenException?**

Fundamentally, an `InvalidCsrfTokenException` is thrown when the CSRF token found in the HttpServletRequest does not match the token value held by the `CsrfToken` repository. In simple terms, if the CSRF token in a user's request doesn't match the CSRF token on the server, this exception rears its head. 

```java
public class InvalidCsrfTokenException extends CsrfException {

    public InvalidCsrfTokenException(CsrfToken expectedCsrfToken, String actualToken) {
        super("Invalid CSRF Token '" + actualToken + "' was found on the request parameter '" + expectedCsrfToken.getParameterName() + 
        "' or header '" + expectedCsrfToken.getHeaderName() + "'.");
    }
}
```

**Why does InvalidCsrfTokenException occur?**

In principle, an `InvalidCsrfTokenException` happens due to one of the following scenarios:

1. The CSRF token value in the request does not match the value in the server session.

2. The CSRF token is missing from the request sent to the server.

3. The session has expired before the user could submit the request.

```java
if(csrfToken == null) {
    throw new InvalidCsrfTokenException(null, tokenFromRequest);
}
else if(!csrfToken.getToken().equals(tokenFromRequest)) {
    throw new InvalidCsrfTokenException(csrfToken, tokenFromRequest);
}
```

**How to handle InvalidCsrfTokenException?**

Here's how you can handle the `InvalidCsrfTokenException` effectively:

1. **Double-check the CSRF Token:** One simple solution is to verify whether the CSRF token is properly included in your requests.

```html
<form action="/update" method="post">
    <input type="hidden" name="${_csrf.parameterName}" value="${_csrf.token}"/>
    <!-- ... -->
</form>
```

2. **Session Timeout Management:** Carefully manage your session timeouts and ensure your application prompts the user about session timeout before the transaction begins.

```java
<session-config>
    <session-timeout>30</session-timeout> <!-- 30 minutes -->
</session-config>
```

3. **Exception Handling:** Create a custom exception handler to handle `InvalidCsrfTokenException` gracefully and redirect users to appropriate pages, for instance, a custom redirect exception handler.

```java
public class CustomAuthenticationFailureHandler
        extends SimpleUrlAuthenticationFailureHandler {

    @Override
    public void onAuthenticationFailure(
            HttpServletRequest request,
            HttpServletResponse response,
            AuthenticationException exception)
            throws IOException {

        if(exception instanceof InvalidCsrfTokenException) {
            getRedirectStrategy().sendRedirect(request, response, "/csrf-error");
        }
    }
}
```

**Conclusion**

Successfully handling exceptions is a vital attribute of robust and fault-tolerant applications. By now, you should be able to navigate and handle the `InvalidCsrfTokenException` in Spring more effectively. Remember, a better grasp on these exceptions will ultimately lead you to build more secure applications with improved user experiences.
