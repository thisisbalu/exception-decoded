Hello, everyone! Welcome to our technical blog where we dissect complex issues into simplified solutions. Today, we will be focusing on a commonly encountered anomaly with the Spring Framework: WsdlDefinitionException.

Let's begin by understanding the Spring Framework and WsdlDefinitionException's place within that scope.

## Spring Framework: A Brief Background:

The [Spring Framework](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.0.0.M4/reference/html/) is an open-source application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform. It has become popular among Java developers owing to features like dependency injection, simplicity, testability, and loose coupling.

## WSDL and WsdlDefinitionException

WSDL, or Web Services Description Language, is an XML format for defining network services as a set of endpoints that operate on messages containing either document-oriented or procedure-oriented information. 

WsdlDefinitionException is a subclass of `org.springframework.core.NestedRuntimeException`. As a runtime exception, it circumvents Java’s exception checking mechanism. This exception typically arises when there's an issue with the defining or parsing a WSDL (Web Service Description Language) document within a Spring application.

```java
public class WsdlDefinitionException extends NestedRuntimeException
```

Now let's dive deeper into the common causes and remedies for WsdlDefinitionException.

## The Pandemonium Caused by WsdlDefinitionException 

The major causes of WsdlDefinitionException generally include:

- Improperly formatted or invalid WSDL document: because WSDL is an XML-based document, an inconsistency in the formatting may lead to WsdlDefinitionException.
- Incorrect WSDL file path: If the WSDL file’s path is not stated correctly or if the file is missing from that specified path.
- Network problem: This often happens if the WSDL document is being fetched from a remote location and the network is compromised.

```java
catch(WsdlDefinitionException e){
  // catch block where WsdlDefinitionException is handled
}
```

## Code Snippets to Produce WsdlDefinitionException

Below is a common code snippet that can prompt a WsdlDefinitionException:

```java
WsdlDefinition definition = null;
try{
  definition = wsdl11Definition.afterPropertiesSet();
}
catch(WsdlDefinitionException ex){
  ex.printStackTrace();
}
```

In this instance, the code is likely to produce a WsdlDefinitionException because the `afterPropertiesSet()` method could fail to properly initialize the `Wsdl11Definition` instance if the WSDL document is absent or incorrectly specified.

## Smoothing the Bumps- Solutions to WsdlDefinitionException

Let's look at some solutions to the problems highlighted above.

### 1. Properly Format WSDL Document

Ensure that your WSDL document adheres to the WSDL specifications. Unwanted white spaces, incorrect tags, or failure to close tags may result in a WsdlDefinitionException. Various online tools validate XML documents against specific norms. Use any of those to validate your WSDL file.

```java
// Ensure XML is well formatted
<definitions name="HelloService"
targetNamespace="http://www.examples.com/wsdl/HelloService.wsdl" 
xmlns="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/" 
xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/soap/" 
xmlns:tns="http://www.examples.com/wsdl/HelloService.wsdl" 
xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
...
</definitions>
```

### 2. Correct the WSDL File Path

Ensure the path to your WSDL file is correctly stated. When using a relative path, make sure to use it relative to the root directory of your application.

```java
WsdlDefinition definition = new DefaultWsdl11Definition();
// Set location. Ensure that path to WSDL file is correctly stated.
definition.setWsdl("classpath:/wsdl/YourWsdlFile.wsdl");
```

### 3. Check Network Connectivity

If the WSDL file is being fetched from a remote server, ensure that the network connection is stable. Using `java.net.InetAddress.isReachable(timeout)` can help evaluate network connectivity.

```java
InetAddress inetAddress = InetAddress.getByName("yourWsdlHost");
if(inetAddress.isReachable(5000)){
  // network connection is stable
}
else{
  // handle network problems
}
```

Understanding WsdlDefinitionException and its causes is crucial to effectively build and operate Spring applications. Being a runtime exception, it can lead to unexpected failures if not well managed. 

By ensuring WSDL documents are correctly formatted, making sure file paths are accurately defined, and maintaining a stable network when fetching remotely located WSDL files, we can manage to keep WsdlDefinitionException at bay. Happy coding!
