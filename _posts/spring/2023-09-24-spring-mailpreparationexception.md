Spring is a popular framework in the Java ecosystem. When developing a Spring Boot application, you may encounter a number of exceptions. Among them is `MailPreparationException`. This article is taking a deep dive into `MailPreparationException` in Spring Boot. We will provide a tailored diagnosis, suggest potential solutions, and share example code for a more comprehensive understanding. 

## What is MailPreparationException?

`MailPreparationException` is a subclass of `MailException` which is derived from the `NestedRuntimeException` class in Spring's mailing exception hierarchy. Simply put, it is an exception that occurs in the configuration and preparation stages of sending an email in a Spring-based application.

```java
public class MailPreparationException extends MailException {
    ...
}
```

## When does MailPreparationException occur?

This exception is often thrown when there is a failure during the mail preparation phase, such as an error while creating a `MimeMessage`, facilitating multipart content, or setting headers or attachments.

Here's a simple example:

```java
MimeMessage message = javaMailSender.createMimeMessage();
try {
    MimeMessageHelper helper = new MimeMessageHelper(message, true);
    helper.setFrom(from);
    helper.setTo(to);
    helper.setSubject(subject);
    helper.setText(content);
    
    FileSystemResource file = new FileSystemResource(new File(pathToAttachment));
    helper.addAttachment(file.getFilename(), file);
} catch (MessagingException e) {
    throw new MailPreparationException("Failure during mail preparation", e);
}
```

In the example above, if the `helper.addAttachment()` function fails to load an attachment, it could lead to a `MailPreparationException`.

## How to handle MailPreparationException?

To properly handle the `MailPreparationException`, it is crucial to understand its root cause. This can be achieved by analyzing the stack trace or logging the exception message.

Here is an example of how to handle the exception:

```java
try {
    javaMailSender.send(message);
} catch (MailPreparationException e) {
    logger.error("Mail preparation failed: " + e.getMessage());
    // perform necessary actions: resend, notify user, etc.
}
```

In case the issue originates from addressing (such as a malformed email recipient address), we can handle it by using regular expressions to validate the email structure beforehand.

```java
public static boolean isEmailValid(String email) {
    String emailRegex = "^[A-Za-z0-9+_.-]+@(.+)$";
    Pattern pat = Pattern.compile(emailRegex);
    return pat.matcher(email).matches();
}
```

## Wrapping Up

Without any doubt, handling exceptions in any application is a key part of maintaining robust software. `MailPreparationException` is just the tip of the iceberg. By identifying the root cause accurately, we can build resilient applications that ensure user satisfaction. 

In this guide, we have covered why and when the `MailPreparationException` occurs, code examples of how to handle it, and offered potential solutions to avoid it altogether.
