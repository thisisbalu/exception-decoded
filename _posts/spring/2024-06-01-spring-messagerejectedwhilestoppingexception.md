## Introduction

Have you ever encountered a `MessageRejectedWhileStoppingException` while working with Spring? If you have, then you know how frustrating it can be. But don't worry! In this article, we'll explore this exception in detail, understand its causes, and learn how to handle it effectively.

## What is `MessageRejectedWhileStoppingException`?

The `MessageRejectedWhileStoppingException` is an exception that can occur when stopping a Spring Integration context. It indicates that a message was rejected while being processed by an integration flow, which resulted in the executor being shut down. This exception is typically thrown when there is a concurrent thread attempting to process a message while the application is shutting down.

## Causes of the Exception

The `MessageRejectedWhileStoppingException` can occur due to multiple reasons, including but not limited to:

1. **Insufficient Thread Pool Capacity**: If the thread pool used by Spring Integration is not appropriately sized, it can lead to this exception. It occurs when all the threads are busy processing messages, and a new message arrives when there are no available threads to handle it.

2. **Long-Running Tasks**: If your integration flow has long-running tasks or operations, it can increase the chances of this exception occurring. When shutting down the context, if there are messages that are still being processed, the shutdown process may not wait for them to complete, leading to the exception.

## How to Handle `MessageRejectedWhileStoppingException`

To handle the `MessageRejectedWhileStoppingException` effectively, follow these best practices:

### 1. Increase Thread Pool Capacity

One way to mitigate the issue is to increase the thread pool capacity. By increasing the number of threads available, you can ensure that all incoming messages are processed, even during shutdown.

Here's an example of configuring a larger thread pool:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableIntegration
public class IntegrationConfig {

    @Value("${thread-pool.max-size}")
    private int maxPoolSize;

    @Bean
    public ThreadPoolTaskExecutor taskExecutor() {
        ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
        executor.setCorePoolSize(maxPoolSize);
        executor.setMaxPoolSize(maxPoolSize);
        executor.setQueueCapacity(maxPoolSize * 2);
        return executor;
    }

    // other configuration beans...

}
```

In this example, `maxPoolSize` is a configurable property that determines the maximum number of threads in the pool.

### 2. Graceful Shutdown

To avoid the `MessageRejectedWhileStoppingException`, it's crucial to ensure that long-running tasks are given sufficient time to complete during shutdown. This can be achieved by configuring a graceful shutdown.

```java
@Configuration
@EnableIntegration
public class IntegrationConfig implements ApplicationContextAware {

    // ...

    @Override
    public void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext applicationContext) throws BeansException {
        ConfigurableApplicationContext configurableContext = (ConfigurableApplicationContext) applicationContext;
        configurableContext.registerShutdownHook();
    }

}
```

By registering a shutdown hook, Spring will wait for all running tasks to complete before shutting down the application context.

### 3. Handling Rejected Messages

If you still encounter the `MessageRejectedWhileStoppingException` despite the previous measures, you can consider handling rejected messages differently. Instead of throwing the exception, you can log a warning or store the rejected messages for later processing.

```java
@Configuration
@EnableIntegration
public class IntegrationConfig {

    // ...

    @Bean
    public MessageChannel errorChannel() {
        return new QueueChannel(new MessageGroupQueue());
    }

    @Bean
    public IntegrationFlow errorFlow() {
        return IntegrationFlows.from(errorChannel())
                .handle((payload, headers) -> {
                    // Log or store the rejected message for later processing
                    log.warn("Message rejected: {}", payload);
                })
                .get();
    }

    // ...

}
```

In this example, the rejected messages are sent to the `errorChannel`, where they can be logged or stored for further analysis.

### 4. Consider Circuit Breaker

If you have external dependencies in your integration flow, implementing a circuit breaker pattern can help prevent cascading failures. Libraries like Netflix's Hystrix or Resilience4j can be used for this purpose. By using a circuit breaker, you can better handle rejected messages and prevent the `MessageRejectedWhileStoppingException`.

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored the `MessageRejectedWhileStoppingException` in Spring Integration. We discussed its causes and provided best practices for handling and mitigating this exception. By increasing the thread pool capacity, configuring a graceful shutdown, handling rejected messages, and considering a circuit breaker, you can ensure a smooth shutdown process without encountering this exception.
