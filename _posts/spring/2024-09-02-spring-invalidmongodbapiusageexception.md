## What is InvalidMongoDbApiUsageException?

`InvalidMongoDbApiUsageException` is an exception class provided by the Spring Data MongoDB framework. It is thrown when there is an error in the usage of the MongoDB API provided by the framework. This exception is typically a result of incorrect or inappropriate usage of the MongoDB API methods.

## Causes of InvalidMongoDbApiUsageException

There can be multiple causes for the `InvalidMongoDbApiUsageException` in your Spring application. Some of the common causes are:

1. Incorrect or invalid parameter values passed to MongoDB API methods.
2. Attempting to perform unsupported or illegal operations on MongoDB collections or documents.
3. Misusing the MongoDB API methods due to a lack of understanding of their behavior.
4. Inconsistent or incompatible versions of Spring Data MongoDB and the MongoDB server.

## Symptoms of InvalidMongoDbApiUsageException

When an `InvalidMongoDbApiUsageException` occurs, it is typically accompanied by a stack trace that points to the exact location of the error. The exception message may provide some insight into the specific cause of the exception. Typical symptoms include:

- A `InvalidMongoDbApiUsageException` being thrown at runtime.
- A descriptive error message indicating the cause of the exception.
- A stack trace showing the sequence of method calls leading to the exception.

## How to Handle InvalidMongoDbApiUsageException

To handle the `InvalidMongoDbApiUsageException`, it is important to understand the root cause of the exception. Once you have identified the cause, you can take appropriate actions to handle and resolve the exception. Here are some general guidelines to handle this exception:

1. Review the MongoDB API documentation and ensure that you are using the correct methods and parameters for your use case.
2. Validate the input parameters before passing them to the MongoDB API methods to ensure they are correct and valid.
3. Check for any unsupported operations or illegal combinations of methods in your code.
4. If using an older version of Spring Data MongoDB, consider upgrading to a more recent version to ensure compatibility with the MongoDB server.

## Code Examples

Let's explore some code examples of scenarios that can lead to the `InvalidMongoDbApiUsageException` and how to handle them.

### Example 1: Incorrect Parameter Values

```java
try {
    // Incorrect parameter value
    Query query = new Query().addCriteria(Criteria.where("age").greaterThan("30"));

    mongoTemplate.find(query, Person.class);
} catch (InvalidMongoDbApiUsageException ex) {
    // Handle the exception gracefully
    System.out.println("Invalid parameter value. Please provide a valid number.");
    ex.printStackTrace();
}
```

### Example 2: Unsupported Operation

```java
try {
    // Attempt to perform an unsupported operation
    mongoTemplate.getCollection("myCollection").createIndex(new Document("field", 1));
} catch (InvalidMongoDbApiUsageException ex) {
    // Handle the exception gracefully
    System.out.println("Creating an index on a collection is not supported.");
    ex.printStackTrace();
}
```

### Example 3: Incompatible Versions

```xml
<!-- pom.xml -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-data-mongodb</artifactId>
    <version>2.2.5.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
```

Make sure the MongoDB server version is compatible with the Spring Data MongoDB version mentioned in the `pom.xml` file.
