The world of Java application development wouldn't be where it is today without the Spring framework; an open-source platform that provides comprehensive programming and configuration models for building robust enterprise applications. However, like any other tech platforms, it’s not free from issues and error occurrences. Today, we are going to zoom in on one particularly tricky exception - the `MongoTransactionException` in the context of the Spring framework, often encountered while implementing MongoDB transactions.

## Getting to know MongoTransactionException

Primarily, `MongoTransactionException` is an unchecked exception that signifies something went wrong with MongoDB transactions. It includes scenarios like instances where the driver was upfront unable to start a transaction or if an operation was commenced that the driver wasn’t compatible to handle due to an ongoing transaction.

```java
public class MongoTransactionException extends MongoClientException
```

## Everyday Scenarios of MongoTransactionException 

Let's look at some scenarios where this exception can occur. 

### Scenario 1: MongoDB Cluster level less than 4.0

Transactions are only supported on replica sets and sharded clusters that use the WiredTiger storage engine and MongoDB version 4.0 and above. Running transactions on clusters backed by versions below 4.0 will result in a `MongoTransactionException`. 

```java
// Let's try to start a transaction in MongoDB version below 4.0, you will encounter:
MongoTransactionException: Sessions are not supported by the MongoDB cluster to which this client is connected
```

### Scenario 2: Trying to run transaction on non-replica set

```java
//This is what happens when trying to start a transaction against a mongodb server running standalone mode:
MongoTransactionException: This MongoDB deployment does not support sessions. Sessions require a replicate set configuration.
```

### Scenario 3: Read concern or read preference incompatible with the transaction

When a read concern other than "snapshot" or a read preference other than "primary" is used within a transaction block, a `MongoTransactionException` will be thrown. Let's simulate it with a piece of code.

```java
try (ClientSession clientSession = client.startSession()) {
  clientSession.startTransaction(TransactionOptions.builder()
    .readPreference(ReadPreference.secondary())
    .readConcern(ReadConcern.AVAILABLE)
    .build());
}
// This will throw:
// MongoTransactionException: Read preference within a transaction must be 'primary'
```

## Resolution to MongoTransactionException

Having identified the key scenarios that can lead to a `MongoTransactionException`, let's navigate towards the solutions.

**Enhance MongoDB to version 4.0+**: Ensure you upgrade your MongoDB version to 4.0 or greater. This will allow your applications to support sessions and handle transactions effectively.

**Use Replica Set Configuration**: If you are planning to use transactions in your MongoDB databases, ensure that the MongoDB deployment is not in standalone mode, but rather, in a replica set configuration.

**Set the Right Read Concern and Read Preference**: When starting a transaction, ensure to you use 'snapshot' read concern and 'primary' read preference for optimum performance without exceptions. 

```java
clientSession.startTransaction(TransactionOptions.builder()
  .readPreference(ReadPreference.primary())
  .readConcern(ReadConcern.SNAPSHOT)
  .build());
```

## Wrapping Up

Handling `MongoTransactionException` effectively entails a three-pronged strategy - updating MongoDB to the right version, ensuring a replica set configuration, and applying the right read concerns and preferences. Following these steps help boost the effectiveness of your MongoDB usage, all in alignment with best practices of the Spring framework!
