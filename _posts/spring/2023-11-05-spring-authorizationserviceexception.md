For anyone delving deep into Spring Security, understanding the various exceptions it throws is crucial for building secure and robust applications. This article throws light on one such important exception – the `AuthorizationServiceException`.

## Inception

In the context of Spring Security, the `AuthorizationServiceException` is thrown when problems occur due to authorization services. This exception is a part of `org.springframework.security.access` package and haply appears when Spring Framework cannot grant or deny access to a protected resource. It's essential for developers to understand this exception well to debug issues related with securities and access controls faster and efficiently.

## Unfolding the AuthorizationServiceException

```java
public class AuthorizationServiceException extends AccessDeniedException
```
As the class representation shows, the `AuthorizationServiceException` sub-classes the `AccessDeniedException`.

Let's now explore the various scenarios where `AuthorizationServiceException` can be thrown.

1. **Invalid AccessDecisionManager configuration**:
When creating an access control mechanism for a secured object, if an invalid `AccessDecisionManager` configuration is provided, Spring Security throws an `AuthorizationServiceException`.

```java
@Bean
public AccessDecisionManager accessDecisionManager() {
    List<AccessDecisionVoter<?>> voters = Arrays.asList(new RoleVoter());
    return new UnanimousBased(voters);
}
```

Note the `RoleVoter` in the configuration. If there is a violation, an `AuthorizationServiceException` is raised.

2. **Misconfigured Security ExpressionHandler**:
Another chance for `AuthorizationServiceException` to arise is when the security expression handler is incorrectly setup.

```java
@Bean
public DefaultWebSecurityExpressionHandler webExpressionHandler() {
    DefaultWebSecurityExpressionHandler handler = new DefaultWebSecurityExpressionHandler();

    handler.setRoleHierarchy(roleHierarchy());

    return handler;
}
```
Ensure the role hierarchy is defined correctly to avoid a `AuthorizationServiceException`.


## Addressing AuthorizationServiceException

The `AuthorizationServiceException` is a broad exception which addresses generic problems occurring with the authorization services. Here is how you can address them:

1. **Check your `AccessDecisionManager` configuration**:
Have a re-look at your `AccessDecisionManager` configuration and ensure it's setup correctly.

2. **Inspect security expression handlers**:
Ensure your security expression handlers like `MethodSecurityExpressionHandler` or `WebSecurityExpressionHandler` are properly defined. Cross-verify the roles / permissions assigned within the handlers.

3. **Ensure proper user permissions**: 
Check if your users are getting the right permissions. If not, it leads to an `AuthorizationServiceException`.

```java
Collection<? extends GrantedAuthority> grantedAuthorities = userDetails.getAuthorities();
```
Ensure to map the roles correctly in `userDetails` so users get the right permissions they're supposed to have.

Remember, thorough debugging is key to resolve `AuthorizationServiceException`. Always cross-verify your configuration, roles and permissions before drawing conclusions.

## In Conclusion

The `AuthorizationServiceException` occurs due to problems in the authorization services and can be a confusing swamp for developers. However, having a clear understanding of its root causes and potential fixes will make handling it a cakewalk. Be patient, tread step by step – each `AuthorizationServiceException` on your way will only make you better at Spring Security.
