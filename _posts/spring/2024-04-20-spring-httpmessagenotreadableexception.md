## What is `HttpMessageNotReadableException`?
`HttpMessageNotReadableException` is an exception in Spring that is thrown when the framework encounters an error while trying to read the request body. It occurs when Spring fails to convert the HTTP request message into an object of the expected type.

This exception is a subclass of `HttpServerErrorException`, which means that it is considered a server-side error. It typically results in a `400 Bad Request` response being sent back to the client.

## Common Causes of `HttpMessageNotReadableException`
Let's explore some scenarios that can lead to the `HttpMessageNotReadableException`:

### Invalid Request Body
One common cause of this exception is an invalid or malformed request body. For example, if you're expecting a JSON object in the request body, but the received JSON is missing a required field or has an incorrect data type, the deserialization process will fail, triggering the `HttpMessageNotReadableException`.

Here's an example that demonstrates how an incorrect request body can trigger the exception:

```java
@RestController
public class UserController {
    
    @PostMapping("/users")
    public ResponseEntity<User> createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
        // Process user creation logic
        return ResponseEntity.ok(user);
    }
}

public class User {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    
    // Getters and setters omitted for brevity
}
```

If the request body is missing the `age` field or contains a non-numeric value for `age`, such as `"twenty-five"`, Spring will fail to deserialize the request and throw an `HttpMessageNotReadableException`.

### Incompatible Data Formats
Another cause of the `HttpMessageNotReadableException` is when the server expects a specific data format in the request body, but the client sends a request with an incompatible format.

For instance, imagine your server is configured to accept only JSON payloads, but a client makes a request with an `application/xml` content type. This mismatch between the expected and actual data formats can trigger the exception.

To handle such cases, you can configure your Spring application to only accept a specific data format or implement a custom deserializer to handle different formats.

### Missing or Incorrect Parameters
Sometimes, the `HttpMessageNotReadableException` can occur due to missing or incorrect query parameters or path variables. 

Let's consider an example where a GET endpoint expects a valid `userId` as a path variable. If a client requests the endpoint without providing the `userId` in the URL, Spring will throw the exception.

To prevent this exception, you can validate and handle missing or incorrect parameters before processing the request, providing a more meaningful error response to the client.

## Handling `HttpMessageNotReadableException`
Now that we understand the possible causes of the `HttpMessageNotReadableException`, let's explore some approaches to handle and overcome it in your Spring applications.

### Using Controller Advice
One way to handle the `HttpMessageNotReadableException` across multiple controllers is by using the `@ControllerAdvice` annotation. This annotation allows you to define global exception handling policies that apply to all controllers in your application.

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {
    
    @ExceptionHandler(HttpMessageNotReadableException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleHttpMessageNotReadableException(HttpMessageNotReadableException ex) {
        // Log the exception and return an appropriate response entity
        return ResponseEntity
                .status(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST)
                .body("Invalid request body");
    }
}
```
