## Introduction

When developing a web application using the Spring framework, you might come across HTTP status codes that are not explicitly defined in the `HttpStatus` enum provided by Spring. These unknown HTTP status codes can cause unexpected behavior and might be challenging to handle. This article explores the `UnknownHttpStatusCodeException` in Spring and how to handle such exceptions effectively.

## What is UnknownHttpStatusCodeException?

The `UnknownHttpStatusCodeException` is an exception class in the Spring framework that is thrown when an unknown HTTP status code is received from an API or server response. It extends the `HttpServerErrorException` class, which is a subclass of `RestClientException`.

## Why does UnknownHttpStatusCodeException occur?

HTTP status codes are standardized responses returned by web servers to indicate the success or failure of a particular HTTP request. The majority of status codes are already defined in the `HttpStatus` enum, such as 200 OK or 404 Not Found. However, there might be cases where you encounter status codes that are not part of the standard enum, such as 418 I'm a teapot or 450 Blocked by Windows Parental Controls.

When an unknown HTTP status code is received, Spring throws an `UnknownHttpStatusCodeException` to indicate that the status code is not known or cannot be handled using the standard enum.

## Handling Unknown HTTP Status Codes

To handle unknown HTTP status codes, you can catch the `UnknownHttpStatusCodeException` and perform custom logic based on the status code received. Here's an example:

```java
try {
    // Make an HTTP request
    ResponseEntity<String> response = restTemplate.exchange(url, HttpMethod.GET, null, String.class);
} catch (UnknownHttpStatusCodeException ex) {
    int statusCode = ex.getRawStatusCode();
    
    if (statusCode == 418) {
        // Handle teapot status
        System.out.println("I'm a teapot!");
    } else if (statusCode == 450) {
        // Handle Windows Parental Controls block
        System.out.println("Blocked by Windows Parental Controls");
    } else {
        // Handle other unknown status codes
        System.out.println("Unknown status code: " + statusCode);
    }
}
```

In the example above, we catch the `UnknownHttpStatusCodeException` and retrieve the raw status code using the `getRawStatusCode()` method. Based on the status code, we can perform specific actions or log the error accordingly.

## Best Practices for Handling Unknown HTTP Status Codes

When handling unknown HTTP status codes, consider the following best practices:

### 1. Log the Unknown Status Codes

To understand the frequency and type of unknown status codes encountered, consider logging the status codes along with any relevant information. This can help track and investigate potential issues.

```java
int statusCode = ex.getRawStatusCode();
log.warn("Unknown status code received: " + statusCode);
```

### 2. Provide Meaningful Error Messages

When encountering an unknown status code, provide the user or application with a meaningful error message. This helps in troubleshooting and understanding the cause of the error.

```java
int statusCode = ex.getRawStatusCode();
throw new CustomException("Unknown status code received: " + statusCode);
```

### 3. Update Status Code Enum (when appropriate)

If you frequently encounter a particular unknown status code, consider extending the existing `HttpStatus` enum by adding the missing status code. This allows consistency in handling the status codes throughout the application and future-proofing against potential changes in the API.

```java
public enum CustomHttpStatus implements HttpStatus {
    TEAPOT(418, "I'm a teapot"),
    WINDOWS_PARENTAL_CONTROLS(450, "Blocked by Windows Parental Controls");
    // ... other existing status codes
    
    // ... constructor and methods
}
```

## Conclusion

Handling unknown HTTP status codes in Spring can be challenging, but with the help of the `UnknownHttpStatusCodeException` class, it becomes easier to detect and handle such exceptions. By implementing the best practices mentioned in this article, you can improve error handling and provide a more robust experience for your users or applications.

Remember to log the unknown status codes, provide meaningful error messages, and consider extending the `HttpStatus` enum when applicable. Handling exceptional scenarios gracefully demonstrates the quality of your application and enhances the overall user experience.
