Welcome back to our tutorial involving Spring, a popular Java framework. Today, we delve into an issue that a few Spring users might encounter when dealing with MVC implementations - The `MvcFoundOnClasspathException`.

## What is MvcFoundOnClasspathException?

`MvcFoundOnClasspathException` is a RuntimeException thrown when the Spring Framework identifies that the `Servlet MVC` module is present in the classpath, but the DispatcherServlet has not been configured.

Here is a sample of what the exception might look like:

```java
"MvcFoundOnClasspathException: An MVC module is found on the classpath but no DispatcherServlet is detected."
```

This typically happens when you have added the 'Spring Web MVC' module in your dependencies, but you have not declared a DispatcherServlet (the crucial Servlet that handles all requests and responses in a Spring MVC application) in your web configuration. 

Therefore, this exception serves as a reminder to properly set up your Spring MVC configuration.

## How to Solve MvcFoundOnClasspathException?

The solution to this exception is quite straightforward. You need to add DispatcherServlet in your Spring application, which will relay requests to the appropriate controllers based on the routing determined.

Here is how you might go about this in your Spring MVC configuration:

```java
import org.springframework.web.servlet.support.AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer;

public class MyWebInitializer extends
        AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer {

    @Override
    protected Class<?>[] getRootConfigClasses() {
        return new Class[] { MyWebConfig.class };
    }

    @Override
    protected Class<?>[] getServletConfigClasses() {
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    protected String[] getServletMappings() {
        return new String[] { "/" };
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, `MyWebInitializer` is the configuration class where the DispatcherServlet is initialized. The `getServletMappings()` method specifies that all the requests coming to the application should be handled by the DispatcherServlet.

Another option to solve this exception is simply removing the 'Spring Web MVC' dependecy from your project if you are not developing a web application.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the `MvcFoundOnClasspathException` is a simple yet vital mechanism used by Spring to ensure its MVC module isn't present without the necessary `DispatchServlet`. Remember, handling requests and responses in the Spring MVC architecture is crucial, and that's where the `DispatchServlet` comes into play. Make sure to configure it properly to prevent this exception.
