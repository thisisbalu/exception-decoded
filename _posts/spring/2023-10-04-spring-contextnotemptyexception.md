Have you ever encountered **ContextNotEmptyException** while working with Spring Framework? Grappling with unpredictable exceptions can wind up being the most hair-tearing part of a programmer's day. The good news, however, part of being a seasoned developer is gradually learning to dance with these surprises and even better, learning to evade them entirely! 

In this article, we delve into the intricacies of `ContextNotEmptyException` in Spring, how it functions, scenarios where it pops up, and finally, how to resolve this exception. 

## Unveiling ContextNotEmptyException

The `ContextNotEmptyException` often arises when invoking `ApplicationContext`. Here, the `ApplicationContext` refers to the interface for an advanced factory capable of maintaining a bundle of services, including automated bean wiring, message resource handling, event propagation, and more.

You encounter this exception usually when trying to add, renew, or modify beans after the `ApplicationContext` is refreshed or initialized. As the term suggests, `ContextNotEmptyException` implies that the context is not empty - meaning some operation is attempting to inject some beans when the context is already active!

In Spring's official documentation, they define `ContextNotEmptyException` as: 

> This exception is thrown when an attempt is made to set an application context, but it is already non-null (e.g., it is already active).

Let's now delve into some code to understand how we might encounter this exception.

## Analyzing With Code

Consider the following code:

```java
AbstractApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("Beans.xml");
context.refresh();
```
Here, you're creating an application context using ClassPathXmlApplicationContext and pointing to the configuration in `Beans.xml`. Now, if you try to refresh the context, you can run into `ContextNotEmptyException`. This is because `ApplicationContext` loads and configures the beans when the context initializes (or refreshes), and once that happens, it's not advisable (or even allowed) to refresh it again.

## Possible Scenarios and Resolutions

Generally, there are certain non-recommended practices that could eventually lead to `ContextNotEmptyException`. Here's how you might tackle them:

#### Scenario 1: Multiple refresh calls
In the aforementioned code sample, a commonly seen mistake is to call the `context.refresh()` multiple times. 

*Resolution*: Always remember that refreshing the application context after its initialization is not a standard practice. Once you ascertain that your application context is working fine after one refresh, there no is need for any subsequent refresh attempts.

#### Scenario 2: Modifying the context post-refresh
Another common mistake, changing the context after refreshing, is a red flag in Spring.

```java
AbstractApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("Beans.xml");
context.refresh();
context.register(SomeBean.class);
```

*Resolution*: Do all your `ApplicationContext` changes before refreshing it. Once refreshed, the state of `ApplicationContext` is considered stable. 

```java
AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext();
context.register(SomeBean.class);
context.refresh();
```

## Handling ContextNotEmptyException

The `ContextNotEmptyException` isn’t designed to be caught and handled. It’s an unchecked exception, meaning it's a type of `RuntimeException`. As it embodies an irrecoverable situation recoverable by retrying, the best course of action is to avoid initiating the conditions that spur this exception to occur.

## Wrapping Up

By avoiding common missteps and understanding what spurs `ContextNotEmptyException`, you're well equipped to prevent this exception from reoccurring. This is part of the elements that absorb the "unexpectedness" of exceptions in Java – piquing your knowledge about when exceptions pop up and why they happen in advance. 

For more information on `ContextNotEmptyException`, check out the official documentation on [Spring Framework Exceptions](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/ContextNotEmptyException.html).

N.B: It's wise to have this mantra when working with Spring: Always consider `ApplicationContext` as a read-only post-initialization or post-refresh. Happy coding!
