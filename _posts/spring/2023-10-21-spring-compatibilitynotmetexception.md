If you've been using Spring Framework for your Java applications, chances are, you've probably come across different types of exceptions. One such exception is the CompatibilityNotMetException. This article dives deep into understanding what CompatibilityNotMetException is all about and how to handle it efficiently.

## What is CompatibilityNotMetException?
In the Spring Framework, `CompatibilityNotMetException` is a type of `RuntimeException` thrown when there is a mismatch in the dependencies versions. A classic example is when Spring is trying to dispatch an HTTP Request but the required dependencies do not meet minimum version requirements.

```java
public class CompatibilityNotMetException extends RuntimeException {
   // code body
}
```

## When is CompatibilityNotMetException thrown?
While using Spring, this exception is often thrown during the runtime, especially the initialization of the bean. If an application component version is not compatible with Spring Framework, the container cannot initiate the bean and generates `CompatibilityNotMetException`.

Consider the following scenario:

```java
import org.springframework.util.MongoDbUtils;
import org.springframework.data.mongodb.MongoDbFactory;
import com.mongodb.DB;

public class SampleMongoDB {
    private MongoDbFactory mongoDbFactory;

    public void setMongoDbFactory(MongoDbFactory mongoDbFactory) {
        this.mongoDbFactory = mongoDbFactory;
    }

    public DB getDB(String dbName) {
        return MongoDbUtils.getDB(mongoDbFactory, dbName);
    }
}
```

In the example code above, if the version of `MongoDbFactory` from Spring Data MongoDB is not compatible with `DB` class from Mongo Java driver, it throws the `CompatibilityNotMetException`.

## How to handle CompatibilityNotMetException?
The optimal way to deal with `CompatibilityNotMetException` is to ensure that all dependencies are updated and match the version requirements for Spring. But since this exception arises during runtime, its detection during the testing phase is vital. 

It's always advised to use the same version of a related set of libraries. For instance, if you're using `spring-core-5.3.2`, you should consider using the same version for other associated libraries like `spring-web-5.3.2` or `spring-data-5.3.2`.

Use the Spring's Bill of Materials (Spring BOM) to manage your dependencies. By importing this BOM, you can ensure that all your Spring dependencies are of the same version.

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-framework-bom</artifactId>
            <version>5.3.2</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

Additionally, some IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse can help catch this issue by indicating compatibility problems. Be sure to upgrade your IDE to the latest version to enjoy such features.

## Conclusion 
In this blog, we elaborated extensively on one of Spring's runtime exceptions - `CompatibilityNotMetException`. We learned its causes and how to adeptly handle such occurrences. Remember, you'll get more efficient and accurate troubleshooting the more you understand your Spring runtime and its associated libraries. 

Remember, next time you're faced with CompatibilityNotMetException in your Spring application, don't panic. Just check your modules' dependency versions, and you should be able to sail smoothly ahead.

Happy Coding!
