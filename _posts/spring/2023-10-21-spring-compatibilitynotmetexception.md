The [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework) offers a comprehensive range of solutions for building enterprise-grade applications, combined with configurations that promise ease of use and broad flexibility. However, it comes with its own pack of exceptions, among which, `CompatibilityNotMetException` can be relatively intimidating. Let's delve into the specifics of this exception and learn to manage it efficiently. 

## An Overview of CompatibilityNotMetException 

Thrown in the context of the [Spring Framework](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html), `CompatibilityNotMetException` generally stems from the misfit between two elements. For instance, it could be due to the incompatibility of versions or mismatched dependencies. 

Bear in mind, you won't find `CompatibilityNotMetException` in the standard Spring's exceptions hierarchy. It's a custom exception used by developers to handle conflicts regarding compatibility.

Now, let's walk through an example to understand how and when this exception might surface.

```java
@Configuration
public class ApplicationContextConfig 
{
    @Bean
    public SpringFeature springFeature (@Autowired SpringFramework springFramework) 
    {
        if (!springFramework.isCompatible())
        {
            throw new CompatibilityNotMetException("Spring framework is incompatible");
        }
        return new SpringFeature();
    }
    
    private class CompatibilityNotMetException extends RuntimeException 
    {
        public CompatibilityNotMetException(String message) 
        {
            super(message);
        }
    }
}
```

In the snippet above, the `springFeature` bean requires the `SpringFramework` as a dependency. We perform a compatibility check in the bean method utilizing the `isCompatible()` method. If the method returns `false`, it throws `CompatibilityNotMetException`.

## Identifying and Resolving CompatibilityNotMetException 

Identifying `CompatibilityNotMetException` could be challenging due to the broad spectrum of compatibility issues that can trigger it. Hence, thoroughly understanding your application's dependencies and configurations becomes crucial.

A useful practice is including a detailed message whenever a `CompatibilityNotMetException` is necessary. 

```java
public CompatibilityNotMetException(String message) 
{
    super(message);
}
```

With an informative message, it becomes easier to pinpoint the problem and implement solutions. The message should mention the context leading to incompatible references, making troubleshooting swift and efficient.

Resolving `CompatibilityNotMetException` depends on the root cause. Some common fixes include:

- Upgrading or downgrading dependencies.
- Correcting configuration to resolve mismatches.
- Identifying and addressing issues within custom code.

## Conclusion

Understanding the `CompatibilityNotMetException` in Spring aids in the efficient management of application dependencies and configurations. Though it isn't a built-in exception, its application in custom compatibility checks makes it a potent tool in a developers' arsenal.

While handling Spring's exception hierarchy can be challenging, the know-how of tackling `CompatibilityNotMetException` can substantially simplify your debugging experience. So, make sure to remember the tips and techniques we went through today the next time a `CompatibilityNotMetException` pops up!
