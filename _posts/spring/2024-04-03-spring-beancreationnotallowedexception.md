## Introduction

Welcome to another informative article where we delve into the intricacies of Spring framework. In this post, we will discuss the BeanCreationNotAllowedException in Spring, a common exception that developers often encounter while working with the framework. We will explore the causes of this exception, its implications, and how to overcome it effectively.

## Understanding BeanCreationNotAllowedException

When working with the Spring framework, you may come across a situation where you encounter the following exception:

```java
org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationNotAllowedException
```

This exception is thrown when you try to create a bean while the application context is not currently accepting the creation of new beans. This can occur for several reasons, such as during the initialization or shutdown phases of your application.

## Causes of BeanCreationNotAllowedException

### 1. Context is not refreshed

A common cause of this exception is when you try to create a bean before the application context is fully refreshed. This can happen when an application context is started, but the initialization process is not yet complete. In such cases, attempting to create a bean prematurely can trigger a BeanCreationNotAllowedException.

One way to avoid this situation is to ensure that you create beans only after the context initialization is complete.

### 2. Context is being closed

Another cause of this exception is when you try to create a bean while the application context is being closed or in the process of shutdown. During this phase, the application context does not accept the creation of new beans.

To resolve this issue, it is important to ensure that you create beans before or after the shutdown phase. Properly managing the lifecycle of your application context will help prevent this exception from being thrown.

## Resolving BeanCreationNotAllowedException

Now that we understand the causes of the BeanCreationNotAllowedException, let's explore some solutions to overcome this obstacle.

### Solution 1: Hook into the bean lifecycle events

One way to avoid this exception is by hooking into the bean lifecycle events provided by Spring. By registering a listener for these events, you can ensure that beans are only created when the application context is ready.

Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

```java
@Component
public class BeanCreationListener implements ApplicationListener<ContextRefreshedEvent> {

    @Autowired
    private MyBean myBean;

    @Override
    public void onApplicationEvent(ContextRefreshedEvent event) {
        // Create beans only after the context is fully refreshed
        myBean.create();
    }
}
```

By implementing the `ApplicationListener` interface, you can listen for the `ContextRefreshedEvent` event, which is triggered when the application context is fully refreshed. Within the `onApplicationEvent` method, you can safely create your beans without encountering the BeanCreationNotAllowedException.

### Solution 2: Use @DependsOn annotation

The `@DependsOn` annotation is another useful tool to handle dependencies between beans in Spring. By specifying the appropriate dependencies, you can ensure that beans are created in the correct order.

Consider the following example:

```java
@Component
public class BeanA {
    // ...
}

@Component
@DependsOn("beanA")
public class BeanB {
    // ...
}
```

In this example, `BeanB` depends on `BeanA`, and the `@DependsOn` annotation ensures that `BeanA` is created before `BeanB`. By specifying the correct dependencies between your beans, you can avoid the BeanCreationNotAllowedException caused by premature bean creation.

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored the BeanCreationNotAllowedException in Spring, its causes, and how to overcome it effectively. By following the solutions provided above, you can ensure that you create beans in the correct order and avoid encountering this exception.

Properly managing the lifecycle of your application context and hooking into the necessary events will help you build robust and error-free Spring applications.

We hope you found this article helpful in understanding and resolving the BeanCreationNotAllowedException. Happy coding!
