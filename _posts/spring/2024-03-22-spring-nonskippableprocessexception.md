*Often Spring application developers encounter non-skippable long-running processes that can bring performance issues or slow down the system. In this article, we will explore a common exception named `NonSkippableProcessException` in Spring and discuss how to handle it effectively.*

## Introduction

In a Spring-based application, it is not uncommon to encounter long-running processes that cannot be skipped or prematurely terminated. These processes could be performing critical tasks like batch processing, data validation, or even complex calculations. However, when such processes become a bottleneck, they can negatively impact overall system performance and user experience.

To address this issue, Spring provides a mechanism known as `NonSkippableProcessException`. This exception can be thrown when a process, once started, cannot be skipped or interrupted.

In this article, we will delve into the details of `NonSkippableProcessException` and explore how to handle it efficiently to ensure optimal application performance.

## Understanding NonSkippableProcessException

`NonSkippableProcessException` is a checked exception provided by Spring framework's batch processing module. It is typically thrown by long-running processes that cannot be skipped or interrupted once started. This exception extends the standard `java.lang.Exception` class.

A common scenario where `NonSkippableProcessException` can be thrown is during batch processing when a certain step or task within the process cannot be skipped due to its critical nature. For example, in a payment validation process, it might be crucial to validate each payment transaction individually, without skipping any.

## Handling NonSkippableProcessException

When encountering a `NonSkippableProcessException`, it is essential to handle it gracefully to avoid performance degradation or system instability. Here are some approaches to consider:

### 1. Retry Mechanism

Implementing a retry mechanism can be an effective way to handle `NonSkippableProcessException`. By adding retry logic, the system can attempt the process repeatedly until it succeeds or a maximum number of attempts is reached.

Here's an example using Spring's `@Retryable` annotation:

```java
import org.springframework.retry.annotation.Retryable;

...

@Retryable(value = NonSkippableProcessException.class, maxAttempts = 3)
public void performLongRunningTask() {
    // Task execution code
}
```

In the above code snippet, the `performLongRunningTask()` method is annotated with `@Retryable`, specifying the `NonSkippableProcessException` as the exception to be retried. The maximum number of attempts is set to 3, but you can adjust this value based on your specific requirements.

### 2. Throttling and Backoff Strategy

Applying a throttling and backoff strategy can help mitigate the impact of a long-running process. Throttling limits the rate at which processes can be executed, while the backoff strategy introduces delays between retries.

The following example demonstrates how to utilize Spring's `@Throttling` and `@Backoff` annotations:

```java
import org.springframework.retry.annotation.Retryable;
import org.springframework.retry.annotation.Backoff;
import org.springframework.retry.annotation.Throttling;

...

@Retryable(value = NonSkippableProcessException.class,
    maxAttempts = 5,
    backoff = @Backoff(delay = 1000, multiplier = 2),
    @Throttling(limit = 10, timeUnit = TimeUnit.MINUTES)
)
public void performLongRunningTask() {
    // Task execution code
}
```

In this sample code, the `performLongRunningTask()` method is annotated with `@Retryable`, and additional annotations `@Backoff` and `@Throttling` are used to define the backoff strategy and throttling limits, respectively. The delay between retries is set to 1000 milliseconds, with a multiplier of 2 for each subsequent attempt. The throttling limit restricts the maximum number of invocations to 10 within a time span of 10 minutes.

### 3. Distributed Processing

To prevent a long-running process from monopolizing system resources, a distributed processing approach can be employed. This technique involves breaking down the process into smaller subtasks that can be executed in parallel across multiple nodes.

Spring provides support for distributed processing through features like Spring Batch's remote chunking and partitioning. By distributing the workload, you can achieve better resource utilization and improve overall system performance.

## Conclusion

Long-running processes that cannot be skipped or interrupted can significantly impact overall system performance. However, by effectively handling `NonSkippableProcessException` in Spring applications, we can overcome these challenges and ensure optimal performance.

In this article, we discussed the concept of `NonSkippableProcessException` in Spring and explored various strategies for handling this exception, including retry mechanisms, throttling, backoff strategies, and distributed processing. By implementing these techniques, you can effectively manage non-skippable long-running processes, leading to improved application performance.

Remember to analyze your specific use case and apply the appropriate strategy to handle `NonSkippableProcessException` effectively.
