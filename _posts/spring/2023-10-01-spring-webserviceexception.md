Web application development today has become increasingly complex, with developers having to deal with a myriad of errors and exceptions. One such intriguing exception that baffles most developers working with Spring Framework is the `WebServiceException`. This write-up will unravel its fundamentals, its probable causes, and the most effective techniques to address this exception.

## Getting Started: `WebServiceException`

The `WebServiceException` extends the `RuntimeException` and is thrown to indicate problems related to the SOAP-binding implementation within a web service interaction. Before we dig deeper, let’s understand the basics of exceptions in Java and the functionality of Spring Framework.

Java exception handling is managed via five keywords: `try`, `catch`, `throw`, `throws`, and `finally`. Primarily, an exception is an event that disrupts the regular flow of the program's instructions. `WebServiceException` is no different. When there's an issue with SOAP binding, this exception is thrown.

Spring is a broadly-used Java framework that helps developers create enterprise-level applications by offering well-defined templates. The ability of Spring to integrate with other technologies smoothly, such as `SOAP`, makes this platform popular amon software developers.

Now that we have covered the basics, let’s delve into what essentially triggers a `WebServiceException`.

## What Triggers a `WebServiceException`?

The `WebServiceException` typically surfaces during runtime if a problem occurs in the web service implementation. Below are a few common scenarios when a `WebServiceException` can be thrown:

- A component or service in the web service processing framework encounters anticipated runtime errors.
  
- Metadata errors, e.g., a `WSDL` has a syntax error.
 
- Messaging errors, for instance, an outbound message cannot be constructed or an inbound message cannot be processed.

Now, let's explore how to handle this exception in the Spring environment.

```java
import org.example.WebServiceException;

public class WebServiceHandler {
  public void handler() {
    try {
      // Your code goes here
    } catch(WebServiceException wServiceException) {
      // Exception handling code goes here
    }
  }
}
```
In this example, your web service related code should be in the `try` block. If the `WebServiceException` is thrown and it matches with `catch`, then the exception handling code within `catch` will be executed.

## Debugging `WebServiceException`

Debugging this exception may require you to sort through your SOAP messages and look for any issues that may be causing the exception. Here is a small snippet to log your SOAP requests and responses.

```java
import org.springframework.ws.client.core.support.WebServiceGatewaySupport;
import org.springframework.ws.soap.client.core.SoapActionCallback;

public class SoapConnector extends WebServiceGatewaySupport {

    public Object callWebService(String url, Object request){
        return getWebServiceTemplate()
                .marshalSendAndReceive(url, request,
                    new SoapActionCallback("yourSOAPAction"));
    }
}
```
You can also override the `marshalSendAndReceive` method to log the `SOAPMessage` details.

## Effective Measures to Handle `WebServiceException`  

As this exception is a `RuntimeException`, you cannot anticipate its occurrence beforehand. However, you can appropriately handle it within your code. Below is an example of how you're supposed to handle a `RuntimeException`.

```java
...
} catch(WebServiceException ex) {
  // Insert your exception handling code here
  log.error("WebServiceException occurred!" , ex.getFaultInfo());
} ...
```
Here we are catching the `WebServiceException` and processing it according to our needs. Logging the fault can be useful in understanding and debugging the exact issue which caused the exception.

## Reference links

For more information on the `WebServiceException`, consult the official [Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/xml/ws/WebServiceException.html).

To get the most out of Spring Framework, you can be a part of their enormous community by subscribing to its [documentation](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework).

The source code examples in this blog are provided as they are with no obligations. Always remember to test your code thoroughly to avoid unanticipated runtime issues.

## Wrapping up

Understanding and handling the `WebServiceException` can be a bit of a hurdle but is crucial for every Java developer working with web services in the Spring framework. This can be achieved with a concrete understanding of the exception's functionality and by being adept in debugging the SOAP requests and responses. Exception handling in Java, especially in Spring, is one of the key aspects that contribute to the robustness of the application.

Through this comprehensive guide, we hope you've gained an intricate understanding of `WebServiceException`, what causes it, and how to efficiently tackle this exception in the Spring Framework environment. Keep coding and debugging!
