In Java, the `MessageNotReadableException` is a popular exception that developers encounter while working with the Spring Framework. This in-depth guide is specially written for developers who desire to better understand what `MessageNotReadableException` actually is and how to efficiently handle it when it rears its head.

Did you know that `MessageNotReadableException` is also one of the most-searched-for exceptions on StackOverflow regarding Spring? This further testifies to its popularity. So, buckle up and let's dive right in as we unravel the mystery behind this widely-encountered exception.

## An Overview of MessageNotReadableException

`MessageNotReadableException` is a nested runtime exception usually thrown when HTTP request handling fails. It is a subclass of the `NestedRuntimeException` class. The exception suggests that a controller was unprepared to handle a certain HTTP request because the HTTP message was unreadable.

Here is a simple example depicting a situation when this exception might be encountered:

```java
@RequestMapping(value = "/example", method = RequestMethod.POST, consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
public ResponseEntity<?> exampleEndpoint(@RequestBody ExampleObject exampleObject) {
    // ...
}
```

In the above piece of code, if an incoming HTTP POST request contains a message body that cannot be parsed to an `ExampleObject', then a `MessageNotReadableException` would be thrown.

## Common Scenarios Resulting in MessageNotReadableException 

Among the several reasons why `MessageNotReadableException` may occur, the most common ones include:

__1. Invalid content type:__ When the media type or the Content-Type header in your HTTP request doesn't match with the `consumes` attribute of the `@RequestMapping` annotation, this exception is likely to happen.

__2. Incompatible JSON structure:__ If your JSON message doesn't align with a structure that can be mapped to your annotated object, you're likely to experience this exception.

## Best Practices to Handle MessageNotReadableException

So, what are some of the best ways to prevent `MessageNotReadableException` from popping up? Here are few methods that are generally employed:

### 1. Validate Media Types

The first thing to ensure is that the media type for your HTTP requests matches the one specified in your Spring Controller method. Here is an example:

```java
@RequestMapping(value = "/example", method = RequestMethod.POST, consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
public ResponseEntity<?> exampleEndpoint(@RequestBody ExampleObject exampleObject) {
    // ...
}
```
If your HTTP request's Content-Type header is anything other than `application/json`, a `MessageNotReadableException` would be thrown.

### 2. Guardian Exception Handlers
You can also use `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler` annotations to catch these exceptions and handle them smoothly. Here is a handy example of an exception handler:

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class RestExceptionHandler extends ResponseEntityExceptionHandler {

   @ExceptionHandler({HttpMessageNotReadableException.class})
   public ResponseEntity<Object> handleHttpMessageNotReadable(HttpMessageNotReadableException ex, HttpHeaders headers, HttpStatus status, WebRequest request) {
      String error = "Malformed JSON request";
      return buildResponseEntity(new ApiError(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST, error, ex));
   }

   private ResponseEntity<Object> buildResponseEntity(ApiError apiError) {
      return new ResponseEntity<>(apiError, apiError.getStatus());
   }

   @Data
   @AllArgsConstructor
   static class ApiError {
      private HttpStatus status;
      private String message;
      private List<String> errors;
   }
}
```
The above code catches all `HttpMessageNotReadableException` and returns a 400 Bad Request error to the client with a custom error message.

These solutions are some of the many ways to handle `MessageNotReadableException`. But it is always best to investigate the cause of the exception to understand the problem deeply.

## Digging Deeper

If you wish to dive deeper into the intricacies of `MessageNotReadableException` and handle it even more efficiently, you can always check the official Spring documentation [here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/http/converter/HttpMessageNotReadableException.html).

Additionally, for fresh Spring enthusiasts, it can really prove helpful to brush up on the fundamentals of the Spring Framework and HTTP request handling [here](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/), which may eventually allow us to prevent the `MessageNotReadableException`.
 
## Wrapping up

Hopefully, this guide gave you a thorough understanding of `MessageNotReadableException` along with its common causes, solutions and much more. It isn't hard to avoid this error if you follow the guidelines mentioned in this blog.

So, the next time you encounter this exception, think of it as a puzzle, not a problem. Happy coding!
