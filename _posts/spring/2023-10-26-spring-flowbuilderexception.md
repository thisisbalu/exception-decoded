Welcome to an in-depth exploration into an exception that's prevalent in the Spring Web Flow framework: the FlowBuilderException. This blog post aims to provide an insightful understanding of the FlowBuilderException, the underlying causes, and feasible remedies. 

## Introduction
Spring Web Flow (SWF) is a component within the larger Spring Framework, enhancing its core functionality by introducing a conversational state and flow-oriented model. However, SWF could present certain exceptions during application development and runtime. One such potential situation is the occurrence of the FlowBuilderException, forming the center of our discussion today.

## Understanding FlowBuilderException
The `FlowBuilderException` is a runtime exception that commonly occurs when developers create and execute flows. There are numerous reasons why this can transpire, including potentially incorrect configuration or unfulfilled dependencies. Before delving into these cases, let's first outline a basic understanding of the `FlowBuilderException`.

In its simplest form, a `FlowBuilderException` represents a problem that has been encountered during the flow building process. It offers critical clues about what's going wrong in the system, often pointing to specific causes or problematic scenarios.

Let's understand this via a simple code snippet:

```java
public class FlowBuilderException 
    extends FlowException {
    public FlowBuilderException(String flowId, String msg, Throwable cause) {
        super(flowId, msg, cause);
    }
}
```
In the above example, the `FlowBuilderException` class extends the `FlowException`, providing an extension for exceptions that are thrown within the development flow.

## Common Causes of FlowBuilderException 
Three prevalent reasons usually cause a FlowBuilderException:

1. Misconfiguration: A problematic configuration in your SWF code could easily lead to this exception. 
2. Unfulfilled dependencies: If there's a dependency that your flow requires and it's unable to locate or access it, you might encounter a `FlowBuilderException`. 
3. Incorrect Bean definitions: When you try to wire up your flow with Beans, and the definitions are incorrect, the system throws a `FlowBuilderException`.

Let's dig deeper into each of them.

## Misconfiguration
Any invalid configuration within the flow.xml file can cause a `FlowBuilderException` error. This could include elements like view states, action states, or transitions that are incorrectly defined.

As an illustration, consider the code snippet below:

```xml
<flow xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/webflow"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/webflow http://www.springframework.org/schema/webflow/spring-webflow-2.0.xsd">
    
    <!-- View State Declaration -->
    <view-state id="home" view="home.jsp" />
    
    <!-- Action State Declaration -->
    <action-state id="error">
        <!-- Incorrect attribute -->
        <evaluate expression="incorrectExpression" />
        <transition to="home"/>
    </action-state>
</flow>
```
In the above setup, as per the context, "incorrectExpression" may be an invalid expression. Consequently, at runtime, your application will terminate with a `FlowBuilderException`, indicating the invalid attribute within this expression.

## Unfulfilled dependencies
When a flow requires a particular dependency and can't find that, it results in a `FlowBuilderException`. 

```java
public class ExampleFlowBuilder extends AbstractFlowBuilder {
// Dependency Injection
@Autowired
private DependencyClass dependency;

public ExampleFlowBuilder(FlowBuilderServices services) {
        super(services);
}

public ExampleFlowBuilder() {
        super();
}

@Override
public void buildStates() throws FlowBuilderException {
        // Dependency call
        add(createState("Start",
        new Action[]{new ExampleAction(dependency)},
        new Transition[]{createTransitionOn("success", "End")}));
}
}
```
If the `DependencyClass` defined in the `ExampleFlowBuilder` class is not declared or meet some error during the Spring Bean creation, it would throw `FlowBuilderException` during the flow execution.

## Incorrect Bean Definitions
Another reason could be incorrect Bean wiring. A common scenario would be linking a Bean into the flow, and the Bean not being correctly set up. 

```java
@Override
public void buildBeanImports() throws FlowBuilderException {
        // Beans Import
        beanImport("controllerBean", ControllerBean.class, Scope.FLOW);
}
```
In the above code snippet, if the `ControllerBean` is not properly defined, it will throw a `FlowBuilderException`. 

## Conclusion
The `FlowBuilderException` in Spring Web Flow is a common exception that arises due to misconfigurations, unfulfilled dependencies, or incorrect bean definitions. Understanding this exception and the reasons behind their occurrences can help developers quickly identify and resolve the issues in their application development.

Remember, the keys to avoiding a `FlowBuilderException` are ensuring correct configuration, fulfilling all dependencies, and defining beans appropriately.
