Welcome to our technical blog, where we discuss various topics related to Spring framework. In today's article, we will delve into the details of the NotReadablePropertyException in Spring and explore different ways to resolve this issue. This comprehensive guide aims to provide a deep understanding of the exception, along with practical code examples and best practices to tackle it effectively. Let's get started!

## Introduction
In Spring framework, the NotReadablePropertyException is a common exception that occurs when trying to access or bind a property that cannot be read or accessed. It typically arises in scenarios where the property does not have the required getter method, or the getters conflict with the property name, leading to ambiguous resolutions. This exception is thrown by the BeanWrapper interface when it encounters issues in accessing or setting properties during the bean manipulation process.

## Understanding the NotReadablePropertyException
The NotReadablePropertyException is an unchecked exception that is derived from the InvalidPropertyException class. Its primary purpose is to signal the failure in accessing or reading a property. Let's consider a basic example to illustrate this exception:

```java
public class User {
    private String name;

    // No getter method for 'name'

    // Constructor, setters, and other methods...
}

// In some other class...

User user = new User();
user.setName("John");

BeanWrapper wrapper = new BeanWrapperImpl(user);
String name = (String) wrapper.getPropertyValue("name"); // NotReadablePropertyException thrown here
```

In the above example, we are trying to access the "name" property using the `getPropertyValue()` method of the BeanWrapperImpl class. However, since no getter method is provided for the "name" property in the User class, a NotReadablePropertyException is thrown.

## Resolving the NotReadablePropertyException
To overcome the NotReadablePropertyException, we need to ensure that the appropriate getter method is available for the property we are trying to access. Let's explore some common scenarios and their solutions:

### Scenario 1: Missing getter method
If a property does not have a getter method, we can solve the issue by adding a valid getter method for that property. Following the example mentioned earlier, we can fix it like this:

```java
public class User {
    private String name;

    public String getName() { 
        return name; 
    }

    // Constructor, setters, and other methods...
}
```

By adding the `getName()` method, we resolve the NotReadablePropertyException, and the property can now be accessed correctly.

### Scenario 2: Ambiguous getter methods
Sometimes, the NotReadablePropertyException arises due to ambiguous resolutions when two or more getter methods conflict with the property name. In such cases, we must ensure that the getter method has a clear naming convention that matches the property name. Consider the following example:

```java
public class User {
    private String name;

    public String getUserDetails() { 
        return name; 
    }

    // Constructor, setters, and other methods...
}

// In some other class...

User user = new User();
user.setName("John");

BeanWrapper wrapper = new BeanWrapperImpl(user);
String name = (String) wrapper.getPropertyValue("name"); // NotReadablePropertyException thrown here
```

In the above code snippet, the getter method `getUserDetails()` conflicts with the "name" property. To resolve this, we need to rename the method to match the property name:

```java
public String getName() { 
    return name; 
}
```

With the modified getter method, the NotReadablePropertyException will no longer be thrown, and the property can be accessed without any issues.

### Scenario 3: Property not present in the target object
If the property we are trying to read is not present in the target object, the NotReadablePropertyException will be thrown. To resolve this, we need to ensure that the property is properly defined and exists within the target object.

## Conclusion
In this comprehensive guide, we explored the NotReadablePropertyException in Spring, its causes, and various ways to resolve it. We discussed scenarios such as missing getter methods, ambiguous getter method resolutions, and properties not present in the target object. By ensuring the presence of appropriate getter methods and resolving naming conflicts, we can effectively overcome this exception and enable smooth property access in our Spring applications.
