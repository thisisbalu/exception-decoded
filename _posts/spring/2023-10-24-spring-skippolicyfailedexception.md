This in-depth guide takes you through the mechanics of handling exceptions in Spring Batch applications, focusing on the `SkipPolicyFailedException`. Being indispensable in any productive environment, understanding how to manage errors and exceptions in applications is essential for an efficient and robust programming experience.

## Understanding Exceptions in Spring Batch

Just in case you are just stepping into Spring Batch, it revolves around the processing of extensive data sets. It executes a series of jobs, and each job is a sequence of steps, with each step including READ, PROCESS, and WRITE methods. However, things do not always go as planned and occasionally, unanticipated exceptions can occur. This is where Spring Batchâ€™s `SkipPolicy` steps onto the stage.

## What is SkipPolicy?

`SkipPolicy` is an interface in Spring Batch that provides a mechanism to specify circumstances under which it is permissible to skip an exception, which might occur during the reading, processing, or writing stages of a batch job. 

In the case where SkipPolicy can't handle the exception, a `SkipPolicyFailedException` is thrown.

## Delving Into SkipPolicyFailedException

The `SkipPolicyFailedException` is a `RuntimeException` thrown to signify that a skip policy encountered an error when evaluating whether a particular exception should lead to a skip. This typically implies a system-level problem such as a database outage.

As an illustration, see the below example:

```java
public class CustomSkipPolicy implements SkipPolicy {

   @Override
   public boolean shouldSkip(Throwable t, int skipCount) throws SkipLimitExceededException {
        if(t instanceof CustomException && skipCount < 5) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

In the above case, `SkipPolicyFailedException` is thrown when the `CustomException` is encountered, and the `skipCount` is not less than 5. 

## Handling SkipPolicyFailedException

While catching `SkipPolicyFailedException`, the best practice is to log the exception and attempt a graceful shutdown of the application, as it signifies a systemic error.

```java
   @Override
   public boolean shouldSkip(Throwable t, int skipCount) throws SkipLimitExceededException {
      try {
         if(t instanceof CustomException && skipCount < 5) {
               return true;
            } else {
               return false;
            }
      } catch (SkipPolicyFailedException spfe) {
         log.error("Encountered an error with the Skip Policy: ", spfe);
         // graceful shutdown here
         return false;
      }
   }
```

Remember that in an extreme case, if a system-level failure doesn't allow for a graceful shutdown, Spring Batch's `SystemException` can be used to forcibly terminate the Batch application.

## Importance of SkipPolicyFailedException

System-level issues such as database outages are not only unpredictable but they can also cost significant production downtime. Being able to catch and handle `SkipPolicyFailedException` allows us to handle these situations gracefully, potentially saving both time and resources.

## Conclusion

Accidents, as we know, do happen. However, Spring Batch offers ways to handle even the unexpected situations, improving the chances of recovery when an exception is encountered. While it is important to prevent errors, learning to deal with exceptions such as `SkipPolicyFailedException` efficiently is just as important for any robust and resilient application.
