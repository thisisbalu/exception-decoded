_Explore and conquer this insightful aspect of the powerful batch-processing framework by Spring_

Spring Batch is an expansive, dynamic framework designed for processing large volumes of data while optimizing speed, efficiency, and robustness. Despite its impressive advantages, one potential bump on the road can be the `NoSuchJobInstanceException` for a beginner or even an experienced developer. This article is dedicated to demystifying this specific exception, providing you with rich contextual understanding and ample code examples for a more hands-on approach.

## What is NoSuchJobInstanceException?

`NoSuchJobInstanceException` is a type of exception that arises in Spring Batch when the requested `JobInstance` does not exist in the job repository. `JobInstance` signifies an abstract concept representing the logical view of a job run. 

When a job process attempts to locate a `JobInstance` from the job repository by its Id that doesn't exist, it returns a `NoSuchJobInstanceException`.

```java
public class NoSuchJobInstanceException extends NoSuchEntityException {
    
    /**
     * Create a new exception.
     * 
     * @param message the message for this exception
     */
    public NoSuchJobInstanceException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
    
}
```
This class is part of `org.springframework.batch.core.repository.dao` package.

## Displaying NoSuchJobInstanceException 

The code snippet below demonstrates how `NoSuchJobInstanceException` may arise in a Spring Batch application.

```java
import org.springframework.batch.core.JobInstance;
import org.springframework.batch.core.explore.JobExplorer;
...
@Autowired
private JobExplorer jobExplorer;
...
public JobInstance getJobInstance(Long instanceId) {
    JobInstance jobInstance = jobExplorer.getJobInstance(instanceId);
    if (jobInstance == null) {
        throw new NoSuchJobInstanceException("No job instance with the id " + instanceId + " exists");
    }
    return jobInstance;
}
```
If the `jobInstance` with the provided `instanceId` does not exist in the job repository, it throws `NoSuchJobInstanceException`.

## Handling NoSuchJobInstanceException

Often, the best practice is to have an exception handler in your Spring Batch code to handle such situations gracefully. Below, is an example of how to handle a `NoSuchJobInstanceException`:

```java
public JobInstance getJobInstance(Long instanceId) {
    try {
        JobInstance jobInstance = jobExplorer.getJobInstance(instanceId);
        return jobInstance;
    } catch (NoSuchJobInstanceException e) {
        //log the error message and return null or default job instance
        System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        return null;
    }
}
```
Here, we catch `NoSuchJobInstanceException` and log it to the console instead of letting the program fail.

## How to Avoid NoSuchJobInstanceException?

The best way to avoid experiencing this exception is to always ensure that the `JobInstance` ID you are trying to fetch from the repository does exist.

```java
public boolean checkIfJobInstanceExists(Long instanceId) {
    JobInstance jobInstance = jobExplorer.getJobInstance(instanceId);
    return jobInstance != null;
}
```
The above method will return true if the `JobInstance` with the provided `instanceId` exists, otherwise false.

## Conclusion

While `NoSuchJobInstanceException` can be a hassle, it's often a product of slight overlooks more than it's a sign of a critical problem. By employing robust error handling measures in your Spring Batch application, tolerating and resolving these exceptions becomes a walk in the park.
