Are you encountering the `MissingWebServerFactoryBeanException` error when working with Spring? Do you want to understand its causes and find a solution? You've come to the right place! In this article, we will dive into this exception, explore its root causes, and provide step-by-step solutions to help you resolve it efficiently. So, without further ado, let's get started!

## What is MissingWebServerFactoryBeanException?

The `MissingWebServerFactoryBeanException` is a runtime exception that typically occurs when building and configuring a Spring application, specifically with regard to the web server component. It occurs when Spring cannot find the necessary configuration or dependency to run the web server.

## Common Causes of MissingWebServerFactoryBeanException

1. **Missing required dependencies**: One of the most common causes of this exception is a missing or misconfigured dependency in your project. For example, you might be missing the required `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency in your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file.

2. **Incorrect configuration**: Another potential cause is an incorrect configuration within your Spring application. This could include misconfigured properties like the server port or context path.

## Solutions to the MissingWebServerFactoryBeanException 

Now that we understand some of the common causes, let's dive into the solutions.

### Solution 1: Check for missing dependencies

As mentioned earlier, missing or misconfigured dependencies can trigger this exception. Therefore, the first step is to ensure that you have the necessary dependencies included in your project.

For Maven users, check your `pom.xml` file and ensure that the following dependency is present:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

For Gradle users, verify that the following dependency is added to your `build.gradle` file:

```java
implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
```

Don't forget to update your project dependencies by running `mvn clean install` or `gradle build`.

### Solution 2: Verify your configuration

If you have confirmed that the required dependencies are in place, the next step is to review your application's configuration.

####  Solution 2.1: Check server properties

Ensure that your server properties are correctly configured in either the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.

For example, if you're using the default server port (8080), the following property should be present:

```yaml
server.port=8080
```

Similarly, if your application's context path is different from the root ("/"), ensure that it is properly configured:

```yaml
server.servlet.context-path=/my-app
```

#### Solution 2.2: Investigate port conflicts

Sometimes, another application or service may already be using the port specified in your server properties. To resolve this, you can either change the port number in your application properties or stop the conflicting application/service occupying that port.

### Solution 3: Review parent and dependency versions

In some cases, the `MissingWebServerFactoryBeanException` can be caused by version conflicts between Spring Boot's parent project and its dependencies.

You may encounter this issue if your project includes both a `spring-boot-starter-parent` and a specific version of `spring-boot-starter-web`. Make sure that the versions of these dependencies align properly.

For example, if your project already specifies a version of `spring-boot-starter-parent`, remove the explicit version declaration for `spring-boot-starter-web` or ensure that the versions are compatible. Letting the parent handle dependency management is generally a recommended practice.

### Solution 4: Check for web server factory configuration

Spring Boot uses an auto-configuration mechanism to determine the type of web server to create. By default, it tries to auto-configure an embedded web server using `WebServerFactoryAutoConfiguration`.

If you have excluded or disabled the auto-configuration of the web server, it can lead to the `MissingWebServerFactoryBeanException`. Check your project's configuration classes, such as `@SpringBootApplication` or `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, to ensure they are not excluding any web server-related configurations.

### Solution 5: Examine your project structure

Another reason for this exception is an incorrect project structure or misplacement of files, particularly the main application class.

Ensure that your main application class, annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`, is located in the correct package. The Spring Boot auto-configuration mechanism relies on a proper package structure to identify and configure your application correctly.

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored the `MissingWebServerFactoryBeanException` error in Spring applications. We covered the common causes of this exception and discussed step-by-step solutions to resolve it effectively.

Remember to check for missing dependencies, verify your configuration, review parent and dependency versions, investigate port conflicts, and examine your project structure when troubleshooting this issue.

By following these solutions, you can quickly identify and fix the `MissingWebServerFactoryBeanException` error, enabling your Spring application to run smoothly without any disruptions.

Keep coding and happy troubleshooting!
