When you are working with the Spring Framework, there's a high chance that you may run into the super irritating `NoInitialContextException`. This exception can cause your app to behave oddly and may also lead to intermittent performance issues. This article delves deep into what NoInitialContextException is, why it happens, how to resolve it, and ways to avoid it in the future. 

## What is NoInitialContextException

NoInitialContextException in Spring is a runtime exception that is thrown when an attempt is made to look up a name, and the initial context has not been set up. This typically happens when we're attempting to use JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface). 

```java
public class NoInitialContextException extends NamingException
```
The NoInitialContextException extends the NamingException in Java. 

## Reasons for NoInitialContextException

The root cause of NoInitialContextException is not setting up the initial context. When we're using JNDI and have not set our environment right, the look-up call for a name fails. This lookup is expecting to receive an Initial Context (The entry point into the directory). 

```java
Object obj = new InitialContext().lookup("java:samples/Sample");
```
If the JNDI environment is not correctly configured, the application will Chuck NoInitialContextException. 

## How to Fix NoInitialContextException 

### 1. Configure JNDI Correctly

Here is an example of how to set up your JNDI environment correctly:

```java
Hashtable<String, String> env = new Hashtable<>();
env.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, 
        "com.sun.jndi.fscontext.RefFSContextFactory");
env.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, "file:/sample-directory");

Context context = new InitialContext(env);
```
A `Hashtable` is created where the `INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY` and `PROVIDER_URL` are set. Then the initial context is created using the environment configuration.

### 2. Use Spring JndiTemplate

One best practice is to use Spring's `JndiTemplate` to do JNDI lookups. This method can handle the underlying context and other issues related to connection factories. Here's an example:

```java
JndiTemplate jndiTemplate = new JndiTemplate();
DataSource ds = jndiTemplate.lookup("java:comp/env/jdbc/MyLocalDB", DataSource.class);
```
JndiTemplate wraps the context and simplifies the JNDI lookup. 

### 3. Verify the Naming Convention

Ensure the name you are looking up is correct. Examine your JNDI source- it could be a web server like Tomcat or an app server like WebSphere- and ensure your naming convention aligns with it. 

## Best Practices to avoid NoInitialContextException 

### 1. Encapsulate JNDI lookup code 

It's best to encapsulate your JNDI lookup code to isolate changes to JNDI APIs and JNDI settings. This strategy mainly benefits when you have multiple lookups in the application. 

### 2. Set up a JNDI Mocking framework for Unit Testing

It's often best to set up a JNDI mocking framework when unit testing to avoid NoInitialContextException. Spring provides a Class called `SimpleNamingContextBuilder` which effectively replaces the default InitialContextFactory. 

```java
SimpleNamingContextBuilder builder = new SimpleNamingContextBuilder();
builder.bind("java:comp/env/jdbc/MyLocalDB", dataSource);
builder.activate();
```
This setup will mock the required DataSource in your test case avoiding any unexpected run-time exceptions. 

## Final Thoughts 

Debugging NoInitialContextException can initially be complex, given the numerous configurations to look out for. However, once we understand the root cause, the solution comes easy. Lastly, the Spring Framework provides us an effortless way to make JNDI lookups using JndiTemplate. It wraps the context and makes it easy for us to deal with JNDI connections.

Of course, there's a lot more to debugging than what's discussed here. For further insights on the topic, your go-to resources would be the [Official Spring Framework Documentation](https://spring.io/docs) and the [Java Naming and Directory Interface Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/jndi/).

Remember, understanding the devil behind the details is where you can avoid `NoInitialContextException` in your Spring applications. Happy coding!
