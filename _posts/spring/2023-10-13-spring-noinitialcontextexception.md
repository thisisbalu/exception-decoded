## What is NoInitialContextException?<a id='what_is_NoInitialContextException'></a>
`NoInitialContextException` is a type of `NamingException` in Java, which arises when a context-dependent operation is invoked on `Context` instances that are not associated with an initialized namespace.

## Understanding the Root Cause<a id='understanding_the_root_cause'></a>
Two common scenarios typically account for `NoInitialContextException`:

- The InitialContext is not correctly set up.
- JNDI resources haven't been properly initialized during the lookup operation.

## A Typical Example of NoInitialContextException<a id='a_typical_example'></a>
Here's a snippet of code that could potentially throw a `NoInitialContextException`.

```java
import javax.naming.InitialContext;

public class SpringDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      try {
          InitialContext context = new InitialContext();
          String myStr = (String)context.lookup("java:comp/env/url");
      }
      catch (NoInitialContextException ex) {
          ex.printStackTrace();
      }
    }
}
```
In the above example, the exception is thrown at runtime if the `lookup("java:comp/env/url")` fails due to a nonexistent or improperly initialized JNDI resource.

## The Resolution: Tackling NoInitialContextException<a id='the_resolution'></a>

Resolving `NoInitialContextException` is typically a two-step process:

**Step 1: Ensure Correct InitialContext**

First, confirm that your `InitialContext` is properly set up. Ensure that the `InitialContext` creation and `Context` injection are occurring as expected. 

```java
Hashtable env = new Hashtable();
env.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY,
    "com.sun.jndi.fscontext.RefFSContextFactory");
Context ctx = new InitialContext(env);
```

**Step 2: Ensure Correct JNDI Initialization**

The JNDI resource you are trying to access must be correctly set up and registered in your application. When using an application server like Tomcat, ensure that the resources are declared in the `context.xml` or `server.xml` files.

```xml
<Resource name="jdbc/TestDB"
      auth="Container" type="javax.sql.DataSource"
      maxTotal="100" maxIdle="30" maxWaitMillis="10000"
      username="root" password="password" driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
      url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mysql"/>
```

## Conclusion<a id='conclusion'></a>
Like many things in software development, understanding `NoInitialContextException` involves comprehending the gut functioning of the Initial Context and JNDI resources. For more comprehensive knowledge, do reference the [Spring Core Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html) and the [Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/index.html).

Remember, exceptions are not monsters but rather signals informing us of code misbehaviorâ€”and `NoInitialContextException` is no exception.
