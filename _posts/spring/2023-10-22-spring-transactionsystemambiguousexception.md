In this technologically driven age, solving coding errors efficiently is critical. One such error, especially in the Spring Framework, is the 'TransactionSystemAmbiguousException.' This detailed guide walks you through the intricacies of this error and the best practices for handling it. 

## Introduction to TransactionSystemAmbiguousException

The `TransactionSystemAmbiguousException` is a unique runtime exception usually thrown in the Spring Framework. This error occurs mostly in situations where two or more transaction management strategies become active simultaneously within a single thread of execution. 

Let's illustrate this with a simple code example:

```java
try {
     // The context with multiple transaction managers
     ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext (MyConfiguration.class);

     // Fetching the service
     MyService myService = context.getBean(MyService.class);

     // Calling a method that requires a transaction
     myService.execute();
} 
catch (TransactionSystemAmbiguousException ex) {
     // Handling the exception here
}
```

In the given example, when executing methods needing transactions, Spring cannot precisely decide which transaction manager to use - leading to the `TransactionSystemAmbiguousException` error. 

## Causative Scenarios

Identifying potential scenarios that could lead to errors is crucial while programming. It allows you to avoid or fix these issues promptly. The common scenarios which could lead to `TransactionSystemAmbiguousException` include:

1. Multiple transaction manager beans configured in a Spring context.
2. Trying to use multiple transaction managers in the same transaction context.
3. Misconfiguration or misuse of transactional annotations.

It's essential to comprehend these scenarios and the concepts behind them for resolving `TransactionSystemAmbiguousException` errors and coding optimally.

## Solving TransactionSystemAmbiguousException: Best Practices

Addressing `TransactionSystemAmbiguousException` requires the tactful handling of multiple transaction managers in your Spring configuration. The general best practices include:

### 1. Using 'DefaultTransactionManager'

When your application only needs one transaction manager, always ensure this manager is declared as the `defaultTransactionManager` by explicitly setting it in your transaction managerâ€™s bean configuration. 

Here's how you can do it:

```java
@Bean
public PlatformTransactionManager defaultTransactionManager() {
    JpaTransactionManager transactionManager = new JpaTransactionManager();
    transactionManager.setEntityManagerFactory(entityManagerFactory().getObject());
    return transactionManager;
}
```

### 2. Using 'Qualifier' annotation

In case your application requires multiple transaction managers, it's vital to specify the desired transaction manager explicitly when using `@Transactional` annotation. You can efficiently achieve this by using `@Qualifier` annotation:

```java
@Transactional
public class MyService {
    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("transactionManagerOne")
    private PlatformTransactionManager transactionManagerOne;

    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("transactionManagerTwo")
    private PlatformTransactionManager transactionManagerTwo;
}
```

In this code, the `@Qualifier` annotation helps Spring decide which transaction manager to utilize when a method marked `@Transactional` is called.

## Conclusion

Understanding exceptions is an invaluable part of programming. `TransactionSystemAmbiguousException` is prevalent among developers using the Spring Framework and can disrupt your workflow if not prudently handled. This guide offers an in-depth understanding and provides practical solutions to fix these issues efficiently.

This content is not just crafted to help you in dealing with `TransactionSystemAmbiguousException` but to prep you in comprehending complex programming issues for an enhanced spring application coding experience. Implementing these best practices will surely make your coding journey painless and fruitful.

Happy coding!
