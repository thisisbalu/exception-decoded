In this post, we're taking a deep dive into a lesser-known but crucial exception that comes with the widely popular Java-based framework: the Spring. Named the TransactionSystemAmbiguousException, this represents a type of runtime exception that might occur during a transaction management operation. Let's unravel the intricacies of this exceptional event in details and demonstrate through real-world code examples how to handle it for a smoother implementation of your Java applications.

## Understanding `TransactionSystemAmbiguousException`

Spring's `TransactionSystemAmbiguousException` is thrown when the system can't decide between multiple transaction managers available in the current context. This exception typically occurs when your application configuration declares more than one type of transaction manager, and the system gets confused about which one to use.

Before diving in further, we need to understand the basics of Transaction Management in Spring. You can refer to the [official Spring documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/data-access.html#transaction) for a comprehensive understanding of this subject.

The essence of Transaction Management is ensuring data consistency in case of multiple database operations via a single execution unit. Managing transactions proficiently is vital to prevent common database-related issues like data inconsistency and anomalies.

## When Does `TransactionSystemAmbiguousException` Occur?

As stated earlier, this exception is thrown when there's an ambiguity in choosing the transaction manager. For example, suppose your Spring application uses Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) as well as Hibernate (or any other Object-Relational Mapping â€“ ORM tool). In this case, both `JdbcTransactionManager` and `HibernateTransactionManager` will be present.

So, when your application code starts a transaction but does not specify which transaction manager to use, the system recognizes multiple options and becomes uncertain about choosing the right one, leading to the `TransactionSystemAmbiguousException`.

```java
// JDBC Transaction
PlatformTransactionManager txManager1 = new DataSourceTransactionManager(dataSource);

// Hibernate Transaction
PlatformTransactionManager txManager2 = new HibernateTransactionManager(sessionFactory);

DefaultTransactionDefinition def = new DefaultTransactionDefinition();

TransactionStatus status = txManager???? .getTransaction(def);

try {
// Your JDBC operation or Hibernate Operation
} catch (Exception ex) {
txManager???? .rollback(status);
throw ex;
}
```

Notice the '????' in the above code? Here lies the dilemma: should the system use `txManager1` or `txManager2`?

## How To Handle `TransactionSystemAmbiguousException`?

The solution is to tell the application which transaction manager to use. This instruction can either be specified per individual operation (granular level) or set a default transaction manager.

### Granular Level

If you want to tell the system which transaction manager to use on an operation-by-operation basis, you can do it in the following manner:

```java
// Operation 1
TransactionStatus status1 = txManager1.getTransaction(def);
try {
// Your JDBC operation
} catch (Exception ex) {
txManager1.rollback(status1);
throw ex;
}

// Operation 2
TransactionStatus status2 = txManager2.getTransaction(def);
try {
// Your Hibernate operation
} catch (Exception ex) {
txManager2.rollback(status2);
throw ex;
}
```

### Default Transaction Manager

If you don't want to specify the transaction manager in every operation, set a default manager. This can be done in the application configuration XML or in Java-based configuration.

#### XML Configuration

```xml
<bean id="transactionManager" class="org.springframework.orm.hibernate5.HibernateTransactionManager">
<property name="sessionFactory" ref="sessionFactory"></property>
</bean>
```

#### Java Configuration

```java
@Configuration
@EnableTransactionManagement
public class DatabaseConfiguration {

    //...

    @Bean
    public HibernateTransactionManager transactionManager(SessionFactory sessionFactory) {
        return new HibernateTransactionManager(sessionFactory);
    }
}
```
In the XML example, the Hibernate Transaction Manager is set as the default one. And in the Java example, we draft the same configuration in code format.

While `TransactionSystemAmbiguousException` isn't a common occurrence, understanding it is an essential part of mastering Spring Framework and ensuring seamless transactions. I hope this post has been illuminating and that it will help you navigate such exception situations with much more clarity.
