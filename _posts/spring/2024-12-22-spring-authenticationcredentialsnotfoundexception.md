Spring Security is a powerful framework that helps developers secure their applications by providing authentication and authorization features. One of the common exceptions you may encounter while working with Spring Security is the `AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException`. In this article, we will explore what this exception is, when it occurs, its causes, and how to handle it effectively in your Spring applications. 

## What is `AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException`?

`AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException` is a runtime exception in Spring Security that signals the absence of required authentication credentials. This exception is a subclass of `AuthenticationException`, which represents any issue during the authentication process. 

When this exception is thrown, it indicates that the necessary credentials are not provided, making it impossible for the application to authenticate a user successfully.

## When Does `AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException` Occur?

This exception can occur in several scenarios, including but not limited to:

1. **Missing Credentials**: The most common reason is when a login request does not include the necessary credentials, such as a username or password.
2. **Invalid Authentication Filters**: If the authentication filter doesn’t set the authentication object properly during filtering.
3. **Session Timeouts**: If a user session has expired, and the subsequent request lacks the necessary credentials.

### Example of When It Occurs

Here's a simple code snippet demonstrating a scenario that throws `AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException`:

```java
@Controller
public class LoginController {

    @PostMapping("/login")
    public String login(@RequestParam String username, @RequestParam String password, Model model) {
        if (username.isEmpty() || password.isEmpty()) {
            throw new AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException("Username or password is missing");
        }
        // perform authentication
        return "loginSuccess";
    }
}
```

In this code, if either the `username` or `password` is empty, the exception is thrown.

## How to Handle `AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException`

Handling `AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException` is crucial for improving user experience. You can catch and handle this exception to provide relevant feedback to users. Here’s an example of how to do this:

### Global Exception Handler

You can create a global exception handler using `@ControllerAdvice` to handle the exception:

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleAuthCredentialsNotFoundException(AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException ex) {
        return ResponseEntity
            .status(HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED)
            .body(ex.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This method captures the exception globally and returns an "Unauthorized" status with a message indicating what went wrong.

### Handling in the Security Configuration

In a more centralized manner, you can also handle exceptions directly in the Spring Security configuration. Below is an example:

```java
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests()
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
                .and()
            .formLogin()
                .failureHandler((request, response, authentication) -> {
                    throw new AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException("Authentication credentials are missing");
                })
                .permitAll();
    }
}
```

This configuration will trigger the `AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException` if the login attempt fails due to missing credentials.

## Best Practices for Avoiding `AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException`

To maintain a smooth authentication process and prevent this exception from occurring, consider the following best practices:

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate the input provided by users. Ensure that both username and password fields are populated before processing authentication.
  
    ```java
    if (username == null || username.trim().isEmpty()) {
        throw new AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException("Username cannot be empty");
    }
    ```

2. **User Feedback**: Provide user-friendly error messages that help users understand the nature of the problem without revealing sensitive information.
   
3. **Session Management**: Implement proper session management to handle user sessions effectively. Consider using "Remember Me" features for better usability.

4. **Logging**: Log instances of the exception to capture patterns that could indicate security or user experience issues.

### Example of Input Validation

```java
@PostMapping("/login")
public String login(@RequestParam String username, @RequestParam String password, BindingResult bindingResult) {
    if (bindingResult.hasErrors()) {
        throw new AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException("Validation errors occurred");
    }
    if (username.isEmpty() || password.isEmpty()) {
        throw new AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException("Username or password is missing");
    }
    // Proceed with authentication
    return "success";
}
```

## Conclusion

`AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException` is an essential part of handling authentication in Spring Security. Understanding its causes and how to manage it effectively is crucial for building robust applications. By following the best practices outlined in this article, you can enhance user experience and secure your application against common authentication issues.
