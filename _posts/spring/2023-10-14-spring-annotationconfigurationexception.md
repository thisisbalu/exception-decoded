Spring Framework is a comprehensive platform often used among Java enthusiasts for enterprise applications. It streamlines the creation of applications and promotes good software programming practices such as Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control. However, any developer interfacing with Spring may have encountered an `AnnotationConfigurationException` at some point or another. This article will delve into what `AnnotationConfigurationException` entails, its frequent causes, and potential solutions backed with relevant code examples.

## Unraveling AnnotationConfigurationException

An `AnnotationConfigurationException` primarily arises when there's a misconfiguration in the applied annotations of your Spring application. This misconfiguration can manifest in various ways such as incorrect value types, a failed attempt to apply incompatible annotations, or simply because the requisite parameters are not passed correctly.

```java
@Component 
public class NewComponent {
  @Autowired
  private String incorrectInject; 
}
```

In this code example, Spring will throw an `AnnotationConfigurationException` since Spring canâ€™t `@Autowire` a `String` (a class). 

## The Causes of AnnotationConfigurationException

Often, the `AnnotationConfigurationException` arises due to wrong usage of annotations such as:

### Case1: Using Incorrect Value Types 

Some annotations expect specific data types for their attributes.

```java
@Component
public class NewComponent {
    @Value("#{ @environment['property'] ?: {|")
    private String defaultProperty;
}
```

In this case, we're treating a string `{|` as if it's a method or field, which eventually results in an `AnnotationConfigurationException` due to wrong usage of expression language in `@Value` annotation.

### Case2: Incorrect Usage of Annotation 

Applying an annotation in an unsuitable context or place, mistakenly using one annotation instead of another, or assigning incompatible attributes can trigger an `AnnotationConfigurationException`.

```java
@Component
public class NewComponent {
  @Transactional(readOnly = "not a boolean")
  public void transactionMethod(){}
}
```

In this instance, `readOnly` attribute of `@Transactional` annotation expects a boolean value, but we wrongly supplied a string value.

### Case3: Misusing Meta Annotations 

In Spring, meta-annotations are annotations on other annotations.

```java
@Scope("singleton")
@ContextConfiguration
public @interface NewMetaAnnotation {}

@NewMetaAnnotation
@Service
public class NewService {}
```

`@Scope` is a Spring-specific meta-annotation, but here we are using it on `@ContextConfiguration` which is invalid, leading to the `AnnotationConfigurationException`.

## Troubleshooting AnnotationConfigurationException

Firstly, begin by downloading your project's source code, then:

1. Find the error log in your console or log management system.
2. Pinpoint the location and type of the error pointed out in your stack trace.
3. Begin correcting the issue from there.

Secondly, ensure your annotations match the attribute value types correctly. When you hit an `AnnotationConfigurationException`, check your code for annotations that have incompatible attributes. Always annotate your Spring components with the correct annotation.

Finally, be alert of meta annotations. Ensure the correct usage of these annotations to prevent an `AnnotationConfigurationException`.

## Conclusion

Although `AnnotationConfigurationException` can be quite confusing, understanding the fundamental causes like annotation misuse or incorrect value types simplifies troubleshooting. Always take note of your annotation usage to avoid such exceptions. When issues persist, engage the vibrant community of Spring Framework users and developers that can offer insightful assistance.
