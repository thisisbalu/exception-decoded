In the grand complexity of the Java ecosystem, assertions stand as a small but mighty tool primarily employed for debugging and testing. Despite their minor recognition, they can have great value in enhancing the robustness of your code. Today, I am going to delve into a specific class known as `AssertionError` and shed light on how it works, when to use it, and precautions to take.

## Understanding AssertionError

`AssertionError` is a subclass of `Error` that Java throws when an assertion fails. An assertion in Java is a statement or expression which your program expects to be always true. If the statement evaluates to `false`, JVM throws an `AssertionError` to indicate this unexpected discrepancy.

For instance, in a program that processes payments, we might assert that the payment balance is not a negative number because theoretically, it can never be.

```java
public class Main {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       double balance = -500.0;

       assert balance >= 0 : "Balance cannot be negative!";
   }
}
```

If the assertion validates `false`, running this program with assertion enabled (`-ea` flag) will throw an `AssertionError`.

```plaintext
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.AssertionError: Balance cannot be negative!
```

## Proper Use of AssertionError

Assertions are not meant to replace error handling in your code but to serve as an extra line of defense for catching and diagnosing programming errors. They are to assist developers, not to handle normal program control flow or to manage user errors.

Assertions are disabled by default and need to be enabled during runtime. This is done because assertions could have a performance impact that we don't want in the production code:

```bash
java -ea:com.mycompany... MyProgram
```

## Do's and Don'ts with AssertionError

In general, do not catch `AssertionError` in code. It is a subclass of `Error` not `Exception`, implying it is a serious problem that an application shouldn't attempt to catch.

```java
try {
   assert false;
}
catch (AssertionError e) {
   System.out.println("Caught an AssertionError." + e);
}
```

Avoid including application logic inside assertion checks. Since assertions can be disabled, any code inside assertion check may not get executed in production environment.

```java
assert (++variable > 0); // Don't do this
```

Instead, increment `variable` outside the assertion check:

```java
variable++; 
assert (variable > 0); // Do this
```

## Using Custom AssertionError

You can create custom `AssertionError` where you can add more helpful debugging information when an assertion fails.

```java
public class CustomAssertionError extends AssertionError {
    public CustomAssertionError(Object detail){
        super(String.valueOf(detail));
        if(detail == null){
            throw new NullPointerException();
        }
    }
}
```

Here, `CustomAssertionError` is an extension of `AssertionError` that provides more details when an assertion fails.

## Conclusion

Assertions and `AssertionError` can act as a robust debugging tool if used properly, helping you catch programming errors right at the development and testing stages. However, remember not to overuse it in situations where traditional error handling methods should be used.

Adopt a balanced approach and employ assertions mainly for scenarios where failure would imply programming errors, and not for executing important code logic or dealing with user data.
