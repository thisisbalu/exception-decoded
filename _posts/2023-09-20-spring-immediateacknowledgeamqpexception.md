The `ImmediateAcknowledgeAmqpException` is a common encounter in Spring AMQP applications. Understanding this exception and how it fits into the broader context of Spring AMQP is crucial for efficiently developing and handling AMQP oriented applications with Spring. This deep-dive tutorial will help you understand the ImmediateAcknowledgeAmqpException, its causes, and solutions.

## Understanding Spring AMQP And Its Exception Handling

Spring AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) is a messaging system developed by Pivotal that simplifies the development of AMQP-based messaging solutions. It incorporates the common characteristics of Spring, such as inversion of control and a template-based design for sending and receiving messages.

But like any complex system, Spring AMQP is not exempt from occasional issues â€“ exceptions. And one such exception is the `ImmediateAcknowledgeAmqpException`.

```java
public class ImmediateAcknowledgeAmqpException extends AmqpException
```

## ImmediateAcknowledgeAmqpException in a Nutshell

The `ImmediateAcknowledgeAmqpException` is, as the name suggests, an AMQP exception in the Spring AMQP framework. It is used to signal an acknowledgment on the `immediate` flag when the broker cannot route a message.

This exception is often associated with the publisher acknowledgments and channel's 'immediate' property. If a message cannot be routed to a queue (because the queue is full, for example) and the 'immediate' flag is set, then the broker sends a 'Basic.Return' containing this exception back to the producer.

```java
@Override
public void handleReturn(int replyCode,
                                 String replyText,
                                 String exchange,
                                 String routingKey,
                                 MessageProperties properties,
                                 byte[] body) throws IOException {
	...
throw new ImmediateAcknowledgeAmqpException(new AmqpMessageReturnedException(
	"Message returned", replyCode, replyText, exchange, routingKey, properties, body));
}
```

## Dealing with ImmediateAcknowledgeAmqpException

To demonstrate dealing with `ImmediateAcknowledgeAmqpException`, let's use an example of a queue named "testQueue" and a message that can't be routed to this queue.

```java
@Autowired
private RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate;

public void sendMessage() {
    try{
        rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend("testExchange", "testQueue", "Hello World!");
    }
    catch(ImmediateAcknowledgeAmqpException ex){
        //handle exception here
    }
}
```

In this case, if "testQueue" is full, or for some other reason the message can't be routed, the broker returns a 'Basic.Return' signaling this exception. 

To handle this in application code, you can use the following try-catch block:

```java
try{
    rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend("testExchange", "testQueue", "Hello World!");
}
catch(ImmediateAcknowledgeAmqpException ex){
    // Log, report or handle the exception in an appropriate manner for your application.
    System.out.println("Message could not be routed to queue");
}
```

It is worth noting that you are free to decide how to handle such cases per the specific requirements and constraints of your application.

## In Summary

In this tutorial, we have covered the Spring AMQP `ImmediateAcknowledgeAmqpException` in detail. This knowledge is crucial as it appears in Spring AMQP applications quite regularly. Appropriate handling of this exception will lead to more reliable and robust AMQP oriented applications with Spring.

Keep exploring, keep learning, you're doing great!
