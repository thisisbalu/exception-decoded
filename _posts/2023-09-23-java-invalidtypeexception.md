Mastering Java's powerful but complex exception handling system is a vital skill set for any Java developer. Among the many error types encountered while coding, there are certain exceptions related to data type mismatch – one of those is the `InvalidTypeException`. It's one of the lesser-known exceptions but is vital to understand as it's important for the sanity of your system's overall data integrity. Our focus for this discussion revolves around understanding this exception and examining ways to fix it effectively.

## Unraveling the InvalidTypeException

The `InvalidTypeException` typically tends to occur in Java's Reflection API and JDI (Java Debug Interface), a part of Java Platform Debugger Architecture. Concretely, it's thrown when a method requires a different kind of data type than it receives. The mismatch in the data type triggers this exception, which is often a result of poor data handling or lack of necessary checks. 

## When does InvalidTypeException occur?

Let's consider a simple example. Imagine you have an integer variable, but you are trying to assign a string value to it. Here's a basic view of how you'd note this exception:

```java
int number; 
number = "This is a string"; // This will throw InvalidTypeException
```

## How to Handle the InvalidTypeException?

The best way to prevent the `InvalidTypeException` is validating and checking your data before using it. Java's exception handling mechanism can catch this error through a `try-catch` block.

Here's an example: 

```java
try { 
    int number; 
    number = "This is a string"; // This will throw InvalidTypeException
} 
catch(InvalidTypeException ex) { 
    System.out.println("Caught the InvalidTypeException: " + ex.getMessage());
}
```

This means that you are aware of the fact that the code you've written might lead to an `InvalidTypeException`, and you are prepared for it. 

## Conclusion

Despite its intangible nature, the `InvalidTypeException` is a standard exception in Java that emanates from a mismatch in data type. Although it appears less frequently compared to other exceptions, it shouldn’t be disregarded. Understanding the nuts and bolts of `InvalidTypeException` and the right ways to handle it are beneficial for all Java developers.

A prudent strategy is to always ensure that data passed to methods align with the acceptable data types. Apply proper validations to ascertain data integrity and use the exception handling constructs to catch any unwarranted scenarios that could break your program. Remember, a successful Java developer is not just about writing code—it’s also about predicting possible breaks and twists and considering it while writing your lines.
