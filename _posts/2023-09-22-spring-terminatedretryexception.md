As developers, we often encounter scenarios where our applications need to handle failures and automatically retry certain operations to ensure the desired outcome. In such scenarios, the Spring Framework provides a powerful mechanism called **Spring Retry**. However, when a retry operation exceeds the maximum number of attempts and still fails, it throws a `TerminatedRetryException`. In this article, we will explore this exception in detail and discuss various approaches to handle and recover from such retry failures in a Spring-based application.

## What is a TerminatedRetryException?

A `TerminatedRetryException` is a runtime exception class in the Spring Retry module that indicates a premature termination of a retry operation. It is thrown when a RetryCallback, such as a `RetryTemplate`, completes all the configured retry attempts but still fails to successfully execute the underlying operation.

When this exception occurs, it implies that the failure could not be resolved even after exhausting all the allowed retries. It provides valuable information regarding the cause of the failure and the number of attempts made before termination.

## Handling TerminatedRetryException

Handling a `TerminatedRetryException` is essential to gracefully recover from retry failures and ensure proper application functionality. Let's discuss some approaches to handle this exception effectively:

### 1. Handling Exceptions Directly

One approach is to catch the `TerminatedRetryException` directly and handle it appropriately. This can be achieved by wrapping your code inside a `try-catch` block:

```java
import org.springframework.retry.RetryCallback;
import org.springframework.retry.RetryContext;
import org.springframework.retry.RetryException;
import org.springframework.retry.support.RetryTemplate;

RetryTemplate retryTemplate = new RetryTemplate();
retryTemplate.execute(new RetryCallback<Void, RuntimeException>() {
    @Override
    public Void doWithRetry(RetryContext context) throws RuntimeException {
        try {
            // Your code that may throw a TerminatedRetryException
        } catch (TerminatedRetryException e) {
            // Handle the exception
            // e.g., logging, notifying, fallback strategy, etc.
        }
        return null;
    }
});
```

By catching the `TerminatedRetryException`, you can perform custom actions such as logging the error, sending notifications, or implementing fallback strategies to handle the failure gracefully.

### 2. Custom RetryListener

Another approach is to implement a custom `RetryListener`. A `RetryListener` is an interface provided by Spring Retry that allows you to intercept and execute logic before and after each retry attempt. By extending the `RetryListenerSupport` class, you can implement the necessary methods to handle the `TerminatedRetryException`:

```java
import org.springframework.retry.RetryCallback;
import org.springframework.retry.RetryContext;
import org.springframework.retry.RetryListenerSupport;
import org.springframework.retry.RetryPolicy;
import org.springframework.retry.TerminatedRetryException;

public class TerminatedRetryListener extends RetryListenerSupport {

    @Override
    public <T, E extends Throwable> boolean open(RetryContext context, RetryCallback<T, E> callback) {
        // Called before each retry attempt
        return super.open(context, callback);
    }

    @Override
    public <T, E extends Throwable> void close(RetryContext context, RetryCallback<T, E> callback, Throwable throwable) {
        // Called after each retry attempt
        super.close(context, callback, throwable);
    }

    @Override
    public <T, E extends Throwable> void onError(RetryContext context, RetryCallback<T, E> callback, Throwable throwable) {
        // Called when an error occurs during a retry attempt
        if (throwable instanceof TerminatedRetryException) {
            // Handle the TerminatedRetryException
            // e.g., logging, notifying, fallback strategy, etc.
        }
        super.onError(context, callback, throwable);
    }
}
```

To use this custom `RetryListener`, you need to configure it with your `RetryTemplate`:

```java
import org.springframework.retry.RetryCallback;
import org.springframework.retry.RetryContext;
import org.springframework.retry.RetryException;
import org.springframework.retry.support.RetryTemplate;

RetryTemplate retryTemplate = new RetryTemplate();
retryTemplate.registerListener(new TerminatedRetryListener());
retryTemplate.execute(new RetryCallback<Void, RuntimeException>() {
    @Override
    public Void doWithRetry(RetryContext context) throws RuntimeException {
        try {
            // Your code that may throw a TerminatedRetryException
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RetryException("Custom message", e);
        }
        return null;
    }
});
```

By using this custom `RetryListener`, you can implement specific actions whenever a `TerminatedRetryException` occurs.

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored the `TerminatedRetryException` in the Spring Retry module and demonstrated various approaches to handle and recover from retry failures in a Spring-based application. By catching the exception directly or implementing a custom `RetryListener`, you can tailor your application's behavior based on the type of retry exceptions encountered.

Remember, handling retry failures is crucial to ensure the resilience and reliability of your application. By leveraging the power of Spring Retry and the features discussed in this article, you can enhance your application's ability to gracefully recover from retry failures.
